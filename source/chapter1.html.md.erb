“I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as a city of
brick.”[^1] Augustus’ famous boast is not without merit. The people of
Rome no doubt witnessed an incredible amount of building in their city
under the reign of the *princeps*. For nearly two millennia historians
have praised the Augustan age for its prolific and resplendent
architecture.[^2] Classicists in particular have analyzed Augustus’
sophisticated building program in order to show how the visual culture
of Rome was an essential component of the so-called Augustan “(Cultural)
Revolution” that saw the city rise out of decades of civil war into an
era of peace and relative stability.[^3] The recent attention to, and
fascination with, the physical remains of Rome’s many Augustan monuments
– small or large, functional or commemorative – is a testament to just
how successfully Augustus employed architecture to monumentalize not
just the city of Rome, but the very idea of the city in the imagination
of the Romans, as well as in the minds of their cultural inheritors.[^4]

This dissertation is not about the physical monuments that Augustus
constructed. Important work still remains to be done in that field of
study as classicists complete the “spatial turn” and transition from an
examination of space to that of movement in and through space.[^5] The
different focus of my dissertation is rather because some of the most
important monumental constructions that Augustus accomplished were not
constructed with extravagant, long-lasting marble, but with the words of
the Latin language in his *Res Gestae*.[^6] Augustus did monumentalize
the city of Rome, of course, but he also “constructed” the *res publica*
anew after years of civil strife had left it in “ruin.” That was his
charge, after all, when he first assumed power as a *triumvir rei
publicae constituendae*.[^7] As this study will suggest, an essential
part of Augustus’ success in accomplishing this task was in how he
skillfully used architectural *discourse* to establish his novel
*constitutio* for Rome – the one in the imagination as much as the
physical one – upon foundations that were at the same time
traditional.[^8]

Augustus was not alone in using architectural discourse to articulate
the work he did to reshape the idea of Rome. Far from it. To think that
the *princeps* was operating outside the shared discourse of his times
is no doubt a mistake – and one that does not fully account for his
success.[^9] Chapter II of this dissertation will demonstrate the
important role that architectural discourse and in particular the idea
of the monument played for Romans in how they “structured” the world
around them, whether rhetorical or literary, actual or symbolic. This
largely introductory chapter will start with an analysis of the only
surviving intact architectural treatise from antiquity, Vitruvius’ *De
architectura*, which was addressed to Augustus himself. I will analyze
in particular the treatise’s architectural imagery so as to draw out
further the close connection that existed between architecture and the
idea of “order” or “structure” in the Roman imagination.[^10] From this
point I will then turn to perhaps the most famous example of this
connection in antiquity: the “memory mansion” that was used by Roman
orators as an *aide*-*mémoire*. The idea of using architecture to
“structure” one’s thoughts is not limited to constructing memory,
however, but is in fact emblematic of a much deeper connection that
existed between physical structures and the way Romans conceived of the
world around them conceptually. And nowhere is this relationship more
apparent than in the Roman idea of monumentality, that is, those
characteristics which make something into a *monumentum* (“monument”). A
discussion of Roman monumentality will lead then to an analysis of two
Augustan authors who demonstrate the concept in action, namely, the
historian Livy in the preface of his *Ab urbe condita* and the
*princeps* himself at the beginning of his own *Res Gestae*.

This examination of monumental architecture’s relationship to Roman
thought as found in these prose texts is essential to establishing a new
interpretative framework through which to analyze the way that the poets
of the Augustan age conceived of their works as *monumenta*. Most
studies on the poetic *monumenta* that will be analyzed in this
dissertation have examined either \[1\] the metapoetics at work in each
case (e.g., as a “competition,” whether between Greek vs. Roman, past
vs. present, or visual vs. verbal media),[^11] or \[2\] tried to match
these “structures” with actual monuments in Augustan Rome.[^12] Although
I will also draw upon both approaches in this dissertation, my goal is
to explore how the poets who built these *monumenta* are interacting
with – that is, employing as well as critiquing – the architectural
*discourse* that existed in Augustan Rome and which was used by Augustus
himself to articulate his monumentalization of the city.

The prose texts examined in Chapter II will provide a framework for
interpreting the poetic monuments of the Augustan age in a new light.
But why poetry? What does it offer that further analysis of prose
cannot? The Greco-Roman tradition is full of poets who imagined their
works architecturally[^13] – whether as grand, stable structures,[^14]
or in the case of Hellenistic poetry as a means of articulating their
(supposedly) much smaller poetic aspirations.[^15] The Augustan poets
were thus working within a long-standing, established tradition that
attached architectural imagery to what we today might call a poem’s
“generic structure.” For these poets to make a metapoetic statement via
architectural imagery was a highly self-reflexive enterprise – one which
not only called attention to their poetic predecessors, but also allowed
them to articulate their own poems as a particular type of poetry.[^16]
These intensely marked “architextural” moments therefore enabled the
Augustan poets in particular to explore the monumentalization of the
space around them in a critical way as they contemplated how their own
works *qua* “monuments” would contribute to it.[^17]

A bit about definitions before I provide a summary of the remaining
chapters which will follow. I use the term “architexture” in this
dissertation not to call to mind the complex architectonic
“topomorphology” of Augustan age poetry that has been the focus of
countless studies on its structural arrangement (in terms of books,
individual poems, lines, etc.).[^18] Nor do I use “architexture” in a
loose way to talk about how “memory is constructed like a text.”[^19] My
use of the term is closes to how the influential French narratologist
Gérard Genette employed the almost impossibly nuanced concept of
“*architextualité*” for thinking about how a text fits into a particular
generic structure (or what he calls an “*archigenre*”).[^20] Genette is
not concerned, however, with the more straightforward way that texts
themselves can configure this relationship in their very language. My
use of the word architexture is meant to examine this connection, that
is, to explore how architecture is an operative metaphor in Horace,
Vergil, and Ovid for how they imagine the generic “structures” of their
own poetry. This dissertation is not simply about metapoetics, however.
I argue that the act of defining their poetry’s architexture offered
these three poets a vehicle through which to engage critically with the
discourse surrounding architectural monuments – a discourse which itself
was critical to reshaping and redefining Rome in the Augustan age.

Chapters III-VI will demonstrate the relative strengths and weaknesses
of this discourse by examining the monumental architexture of Horace’s
*Odes* (23 BCE), Vergil’s *Aeneid* (18 BCE), and Ovid’s *Metamorophoses*
(8 CE) in juxtaposition to that of Augustus’ own *Res Gestae* (14 CE).
In order to tease out the subtle nuances of this sophisticated discourse
in the space provided by a dissertation-length study I will be examining
closely these texts themselves. I will therefore not be providing an
in-depth architectural analysis of any physical monumental structure in
Rome. This does not mean that I believe the physical environment of the
city was at all irrelevant to how and why the Augustan poets built their
poetic *monumenta*. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid – these three authors
experienced first-hand the transformation of Rome into a city of marble
monuments during the span of the Augustan age.[^21] It is not
surprising, then, that they might turn to monumental architecture as the
signifier with which to express something about their own
“constructions.” What I want to emphasize again is that my focus will be
on how real and poetic monuments are discussed – and to what ends – by
Augustus and the poets of his age. These poets and their *princeps* were
all tapping into the common language which monumental discourse supplied
when they articulated what made their works monumental. And it is that
discourse which is in much greater need of scholarly attention than the
physical structures themselves.

I will begin my analysis of Roman architexture in Chapter III with
Horace’s lyrical *Odes*. After consistently making claims that one
should aim for the “golden mean” (*aurea mediocritas*, *C*. 2.10.5) and
outwardly lamenting the excesses of contemporary architecture,[^22] the
poet appears to make a remarkable “about-face” at the end of his first
publication of the collection. In the final poem, *C*. 3.30, Horace
claims to have built a *monumentum* that will not only be higher than
the pyramids but which will even escape the grasp of decaying time
itself. I will argue that this apparent contradiction between the
content of his lyric and the “form” which he ultimately gives it is
anticipated throughout the *Odes* by a type of rhetorical disavowal –
what I term an “inverted” *recusatio* – that allows the poet to
incorporate into his lyric structure that which he claims to
exclude.[^23] By using this rhetorical device to establish a delicate
though perfect balance of tensions Horace can erect a dynamic and
innovative “monument” of lyric poetry while – or rather *through* –
claiming to be “traditional.” This method of innovating without
destabilizing the structure of the tradition will then be compared to
the strategies that Augustus used when discussing his own buildings in
the *Res Gestae*. Both poet and *princeps*, I will suggest, use the idea
of a stable structure provided by monuments to balance present
innovations against past traditions – generic for the one, social and
political for the other.

The subsequent analysis of Vergil’s *Aeneid* in Chapters IV-V will
likewise examine what the epic poet has to say about architecture and
monuments in the poem before then turning to how he might be fashioning
his poem itself as a *monumentum*. Because of the epic’s size it will be
necessary to break up the analysis of its architexture into two separate
chapters. Chapter IV will treat two of the most common and significant
architectural tropes of the poem, artificial caves and deceptive
labyrinths, as they demonstrate a very different focus on the part of
the poet from what can be found in the *Odes*. The disruptive forces of
Vergil’s poem are not external, but rather are shown to have been
trapped *inside* these grand structures. As we will see, however,
despite their size and divine craftsmanship these constructions are
shown to “fail” again and again – thereby releasing the violent forces
of Rome’s past contained within them.[^24] Chapter V will then focus in
particular on the epic’s *monumenta* – including the ones that Anchises
(mis)remembers while on Crete, the ones found on Doors of Daedalus in
the form of the Minotaur, the ones in the environs of pre-Rome, and the
multiple ones that the baldric of Pallas may represent[^25] – before
turning to how they all can help us to understand the poem itself as a
kind of *monumentum*.

Taken together Chapters IV and V will examine the way that Vergil’s
architexture is less about keeping out those external forces which could
disrupt the *status quo* than about the chaos and violence of Rome’s
past – distant and very recent – that the poem-as-monument tries to
contain within its magnificent epic surface. What I aim to do in these
two chapters is to explore how Vergil is engaging with the monumental
discourse of Augustan Rome through a poem whose surface might be as
resplendent as a Roman temple, but whose interior hides a chaotic force
that should not be forgotten lest it break free and cause the past to
repeat itself. A return to the *Res Gestae* at the end of Chapter V will
set in further relief how Augustus dealt in his own monumental discourse
with the *furor* and chaos of Rome’s past which he too needed to contain
when attempting to construct a new Roman *constitutio*.

In Chapter VI, as the dissertation itself approaches its end, I will
then examine the conclusion of another “epic” poem, Ovid’s
*Metamorphoses*, to see how a poet writing at the far end of the
Augustan age further explores the ideas of stability and instability in
the monumental edifices examined in Horatian lyric and Vergilian epic,
respectively. The metaphor of a poem as a *monumentum* may have begun to
run its course as something fresh and dynamic by the conclusion of the
Augustan age. As I will argue, however, Ovid’s poem represents not the
dying of this architectural metaphor but rather its evolution to reflect
the way in which Augustus himself had re-arranged the boundaries which
had structured Roman space and Roman identity during Rome’s rise to
power. The late Augustan poet concludes his *Metamorphoses* as Horace
does in his *Odes*, namely, by claiming that he too has constructed a
monument.[^26] Ovid’s structure is rather different from that of his
Augustan predecessor, however. Like the content of his poem itself, in
fact, the monument that Ovid has constructed seems to transcend its own
boundaries, that is, to become a structure without a structure.[^27] I
argue that this transcendence of structure mirrors the way that the
boundaries between public and private space also fade away in the final
chapter of *Res Gestae*. It might be, in fact, that the most important
“construction” that Augustus completed was not just to build a new *res
publica* without destabilizing the foundations of the past, as Horace
does with his *monumentum*. Nor was it to give a frame to a new
understanding of what it meant to be Roman while keeping the horrors of
the past present, as Vergil accomplishes in his poem. Even more
important perhaps was how the *princeps* carefully articulated his own
constructions in the *Res Gestae* as a means of radically renegotiating
the boundaries between his property and that of the state.[^28]

My conclusion in Chapter VII will look to the broader consequences of
what an analysis of this “dialogue” between the poets and *princeps* can
teach us about monumentality today. I will provide a brief survey of the
idea of the monument in modernity in order to show by way of contrast
that the various ways which the Romans embraced the dual nature of
monuments to be both stable and unstable might just provide a more
productive alternative to the at times rather limiting discourse
surrounding modern monumentality.[^29]

Let us now return for a moment, though, to the words that began this
introduction: “I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as
a city of brick.” This boast is more nuanced than it might first appear.
The *princeps* is not claiming to have knocked down Rome and replaced it
with something new. Even if the material is different, the *structure*
is importantly still the same. Rome is still Rome – and its ancient
foundations lie untouched. This is not by chance. Augustus was
incredibly careful with his use of monumental discourse to articulate
the Rome that he (re-)constructed. And this dissertation will attempt to
suggest why.

[^1]: Cf. Suet. *Div*. *Aug*. 28.3: …*Augustus urbem adeo excoluit, ut
    iure sit gloriatus marmoream se relinquere, quam latericiam
    accepisse*.

[^2]: In the very first chapter of his *Siècle de Louis XIV*, for
    example, Voltaire lists the age of Augustus as one of the only
    “lucky ages...in which the arts were perfected and which – by
    serving as periods to the greatness of the human spirit – are the
    example for posterity” (*âges heureux*...*où les arts ont été
    perfectionnés, et qui, servant d’époque à la grandeur de l’esprit
    humain, sont l’exemple de la postérité*, 1751 \[1819\], 188-189)*.*
    The twentieth-century architectural theorist Sigfried Giedion (1949,
    646-647) would even go so far as to say that “\[w\]e do not doubt
    that in some periods there has existed a unity of culture. In those
    periods imagination and the external world flowed into one another.
    Then the spirit was not condemned to go its way alone, and reality
    had not the single meaning of struggle for existence. Those were the
    happy hours of mankind, but they have been rare and of tragic
    brevity. \[...\] \[S\]o it was in Rome during the lustrous reign of
    Augustus. \[...\] These periods, with their unity of intellectual,
    emotional, and political culture, are those in which life has been
    able to manifest such splendor as is possible to man.”

[^3]: Zanker 1988 is still in many ways the standard for an approach to
    Roman architecture of the Augustan age which focuses on the remains
    that have survived either physically or through the images from
    coins, painting, and literature. See also F. R. Brown 1961,
    Ward-Perkins 1981 \[1994\], 21-45, Gros 1976, Kellum 1981, Favro
    1996, Galinsky 1996, Larmour and Spencer 2007a, and Wallace-Hadrill
    2008, 73-211.

[^4]: See Edwards 1996, esp. 69-135, and Galinsky 2014, 135-162.

[^5]: See Ewald and Noreña 2010a, Laurence and Newsome 2011, and now
    Favro 2014.

[^6]: For Augustus as a rhetorical figure see Lamp 2013. Lamp argues
    that “Augustus and his administration turned to traditional Roman
    rhetorical theory and practice…to inform the Augustan cultural
    campaigns.” The rhetorical “artifacts” that the scholar analyzes
    range from speeches to “buildings, monuments, coins, altars, and
    even city planning” (6). The *Res Gestae* itself has been the topic
    of much recent scholarship concerning the way Augustus’ inscribed
    “autobiography” helped fashion a particular image of the *princeps*
    and the Augustan age, including Ramage 1987, Ridley 2003, Cooley
    2009, 1-43. See also Stuart 1905, 429-440, for an outdated but still
    useful examination of Augustus’ inscriptional practices when it
    comes to the monuments of the period, and Syme 1939, 520-524,
    presenting an insightful (though perhaps overly hostile) account of
    the rhetorical stance that Augustus takes up in the *Res Gestae*.

[^7]: *RGDA* 1.4: “In the same year, moreover, the people elected me as
    consul…and as triumvir for the purpose of establishing the state”
    (*populus autem eodem anno me consulem…et triumvirum rei publicae
    constituendae creavit*).

[^8]: Although classicists have treated the “discourse of monumentality”
    in the ancient world previously, an application to the poetry of the
    Augustan age is largely lacking. Although Elsner 1994 presents a
    useful overview of how the discourse functions in ancient historians
    from Herodotus to Pausanias, the approach most similar to mine can
    be found in Fowler 2000, 193-219. His discussion of the very thin
    line between “monument” and “ruin” has been particularly influential
    for my own reading of Roman poetry in the Augustan age. For other
    classicist discussions of Roman monumentality see also Bodel 1987,
    Rea 2007, E. Thomas 2007, Roller 2010, Thomas and Meyers 2012, and
    now Jenkyns 2013, 311-364.

[^9]: The idea that architectural discourse was an important one in late
    republican and Augustan literature is by no means novel. Mazzolini
    1970, Ceauṣescu 1976, and Labate 1991 each treats the impact that
    the idea of Rome as a city had on Roman thought. F. R. Brown 1963,
    Gros 1991, Callebat 1994, Caye 2011, and now Elsner and Meyer 2014,
    35-114, all tackle the complex nexus of architecture and rhetoric.
    Whereas Edwards 1996 present the “Romes” that texts of several eras
    have fashioned, Reitz 2013 argues “that describing the process of
    (architectural) construction within a literary text can also be a
    way of encouraging the reader to consider the (literary)
    construction of the text itself” (8). Moreover, several excellent
    and detailed studies have attempted to find meaning in architecture
    that goes beyond the physical structures within the works of Cicero,
    Livy, and Vitruvius, including Vasaly 1993, on Cicero’s manipulation
    of monuments in his oratory, Jaegar 1997, on how Livy uses monuments
    – both within and including his own work – to construct a Rome for
    his readers, and McEwan 2003, on Vitruvian constructions of empire.

[^10]: On the Roman *ars memoriae* see Rossi 1960, 1-14, Yates 1966,
    1-49, Blum 1969, Leach 1988, 75-78, Bergmann 1994, and now Möller
    2013. See Wilson 1988, 75-78, and Said 2000, 179-180, for
    non-classicist perspectives on the idea of the art of memory and how
    it is different for us in modernity from what it was for Greeks and
    Romans in antiquity.

[^11]: Scholars of Augustan poetry have often looked at the metapoetic
    competition between text and building. Recent examples of a
    metapoetic approach can be found in Jaeger 1990, Labate 1991,
    Deremetz 2001, Meban 2008, Armstrong 2009, and Jones 2011. It should
    be noted, though, that Deremetz 2001, 144, does warn that any such
    metapoetic analysis of these texts should be handled “*avec la plus
    grande prudence*,” as these passages are often more complicated than
    they might initially appear.

[^12]: For the ways that these three Augustan poets are writing in
    response to particular monuments in Rome see Jaeger 1995, on Horace
    *C.* 1.8 and the monuments of Campus Martius; Boyle 2003, 1-62,
    where the scholar treats several passages in the works of Ovid that
    engage with monuments in Rome; Barchiesi 2005, looking to Augustan
    poetry for how to understand specific Augustan monuments (and *vice
    versa*) in suggesting that we should see a kind of “intertextuality”
    between the two media; Harrison 2006, on the way that Vergil’s
    *Aeneid* is in dialogue with the monuments of the Augustan age; Rea
    2007, examining the responses of Ovid (as well as Tibullus and
    Propertius) to the physical construction of what the scholar calls
    “archaic-Augustan Rome” on Palatine and Capitoline Hills; and
    Dufallo 2013, 108-136, for an exploration of the relationship
    between Vergil’s *templum* at the beginning of *Georgics* 3 with
    Augustus’ temple of Palatine Apollo (in addition to Propertius’
    description of the same in Prop. 2.31). Welch 2005 balances a
    metapoetic approach with an attention to the competition between
    specific Augustan monuments and the account of those same spaces in
    Book 4 of Propertius’ poems.

[^13]: See Reitz 2013, 105-110, for a concise survey (with bibliography)
    of “architectural poetics” in Greek literature, as well as Newlands
    2014, providing an overview of architectural ecphrasis in Roman
    poetry, with particular attention to the poetry of the Augustan age
    (60-67).

[^14]: Cf. Pind. *Ol*. 6.1-4, *Pyth*. 6.10-18; Aristoph. *Pax* 749-750.
    See Reitz 2013, 106-107, for discussion of these passages.

[^15]: Cf. Theocr. *Id*. 7.45-48. Although Callimachus does not use
    architectural metaphors in what remains of his poetry, the idea of
    grand “epic” spaces is opposed in his works to the small, more
    manageable scale of his poetics (cf. Call. *H*. 2.106-110).

[^16]: Cf. Verg. *G*. 3.8-16; Hor. *C*. 3.1.44-48, 3.30.1-5; Ov. *Met*.
    15. 871-879.

[^17]: Armstrong 2009 makes the general claim that these poets are able
    to provide insight into the rapid monumentalization of Augustan Rome
    because “they have the flexibility to offer a more nuanced
    reflection on these swiftly sprouting marvels than any architect or
    sculptor, and the room to explore, rather than simply represent, the
    fears and aspirations of their age, and the role of the artist
    within it” (76).

[^18]: Eriksen 2001, xiv, defines the concept of “topomorphology” as the
    “analytical method that examines the distribution of rhetorical
    markers to clarify the structure and plot of a text.” This approach
    – as exemplified by Collinge 1961, Dettmer 1983, and Santirocco
    1986, to name only a few – has been very fruitful for the study of
    Horace’s *Odes*, in particular, even if it seems to have run its
    course for now.

[^19]: See Ender 2005, 15-16.

[^20]: Genette 1979.

[^21]: Propertius was also writing during the Augustan age and likewise
    relies on the language of architecture and monumentality in
    interesting ways (cf. Prop. 3.2, 4.1, 4.6-7), as Welch 2005 has
    demonstrated through her close readings of how the poet “constructs”
    Rome vis-à-vis his “elegiac cityscapes.” The elegiac poetry of
    Propertius and much of Ovid’s corpus will not be included in this
    dissertation, however, in order to keep the focus specifically on
    lyric and epic poetry.

[^22]: Cf. Hor. *C*. 2.10, 2.15, 2.18, and 3.1.

[^23]: See Lynn 1995, 35-36, for a concise discussion of how Horace
    inverts the typical *recusatio* of Augustan poets. (Lynn was
    anticipated in this interpretation by both Commager 1962, 114-116,
    and Smith 1968.) See also Davis 1991, Lowrie 1997, and Harrison
    2007b, 168-206, for three studies that carefully parse the
    rhetorical disavowals found in Horace’s *Odes*.

[^24]: Putnam 1965 and Bartsch 1998 both present several thematic links
    between the artificial caves of the poem, which include the Cave of
    Aeolus in Book 1, the “cave” inside the Trojan Horse in Book 2, and
    Cacus’ cave in Book 8. The labyrinths I will be focusing on can be
    found at *Aen*. 5.580-603 and 6.14-35. See Fitzgerald 1984 and
    Miller 1995 for alternative ways of interpreting the connection
    between these two labyrinths. Doob 1990, 227-253, provides a lengthy
    (and at times overly subtle) examination of the idea of the
    labyrinth in the *Aeneid*.

[^25]: Cf. Verg. *Aen*. 3.102-110, 6.25-31, 8.307-348, 12.945-952.

[^26]: Much has been written on this famous conclusion to the
    *Metamorphoses*, including Fränkel 1945 \[1969\], 110-111; Anderson
    1963, 27; Segal 1969b; Woodman 1974, 127-128; Bömer 1986 488-451;

    and Feldherr 2010, 78-83.

[^27]: Woodman 1974, 128, sees the lack of precision in Ovid’s metaphor
    for his poem as a kind of unintentional “imagistic fragmentation.” I
    argue that the “fragmentation” is quite intentional – as well as
    very important to understanding the kind of monument that Ovid has
    constructed through his poetry.

[^28]: See Milnor 2005, 1-139, on the way that Augustus brought the
    private into the public (and *vice versa*) through the imperial
    *domus*. See also Wiseman 1987, Eck 1997, and Wallace-Hadrill 2008
    for more discussion of the renegotiation of the boundaries of public
    and private in this period.

[^29]: The bibliography on the idea of the monument in modern thought is
