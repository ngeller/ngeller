---

Horace is a poet of structure.[^120] And no more so than in his *Odes*.
Scholars again and again refer to his poems using architectural
vocabulary.[^121] It is almost more of a surprise, in fact, when a
scholar of Horace does *not* discuss the “structure” of an individual
poem, of a single book, or of the collection as a whole. This sense of
structure can include the more literal way that different poems are
arranged within and between themselves, that is, the “architectonics” of
Horace’s poetry. The idea of structure can also extend beyond this
organizational sense, though, to the more metaphorical ways in which
Horace has “constructed” his *Odes*.[^122] In Gregson Davis’ study of
the complexities of the Horatian lyric voice, for instance, he considers
the *Odes* to be “an ideational building, which it is part of the
business of the critic to reconstruct.”[^123]

This use of architectural discourse to discuss Horace’s *Odes* is no
accident. The poet himself famously proclaims his first collection of
lyric poetry to be a *monumentum* – one higher than the pyramids no less
– and this image has influenced how readers (and scholars) thereafter
have understood and imagined the *Odes*.[^124] This chapter will look at
the “structure” of the *Odes*, too, but not in the sense of a lyric
collection with a brilliant design of lines, poems, and books. Nor will
I be using architectural metaphors only to introduce or summarize – as
Davis does – how I as a scholar of the *Odes* might read Horace’s lyric
corpus. The focus of this chapter is rather to examine Horace’s
architexture, that is, the architectural imagery that the poet himself
employs to represent the generic limits of his poetry. The point of this
analysis is not merely to admire or praise Horace’s amazing “structure,”
as so many rightly have. I aim rather to show how engaging in
architectural discourse of this sort allows the poet to redefine
“traditional” lyric space and time in a way that puts him in dialogue
with Augustus’ own redefinition of traditional Roman structures in the
language of the *Res Gestae*.

What is “traditional” lyric time and space in the *Odes*? It is not
simply the dimensions that Horace’s lyric predecessors, Greek and Roman,
had crafted in their poems. Horace was starting fresh in the sense that
when he “decided to compose lyric, despite experimentation by
Callimachus, Theocritus, Laevius, and Catullus,[^125] the kind was dead,
that is, there was no living tradition of lyric to generate some sort of
‘natural,’ rule-generating form.”[^126] What counted as “traditional”
was therefore open to interpretation and debate – just as it was in the
politics and culture of the Augustan age more broadly.[^127] Horace
defined the spatio-temporal limits of his lyric not so much with an eye
to past lyric, I would argue, as with an ear to the discourse regarding
the redefinition of traditional Roman structures in his present. In what
I will suggest was a particularly Augustan move the poet built his lyric
structure to be simultaneously “traditional” *and* innovative enough to
have extrageneric material as part of its definition. As this chapter
will demonstrate, moreover, Horace accomplished this seemingly
paradoxical construction through a delicate balancing of apparent
opposites to be in perfect tension with each other: the private,
personal *hic et nunc* (“here and now”) of his lyric, on the one hand,
and the public, political dimensions of epic that he claims are
unfitting for his lyre, on the other.[^128]

Therefore, while Horace’s Greek lyric predecessors are important to his
*Odes*,[^129] and their poetry forms the basis for many of the poems
(and their meters) in the corpus,[^130] I will not be looking directly
at their influence for the present analysis. Horace was engaging in a
poetic enterprise which was radically different from any that his
precursors, Greek or Roman, had attempted in this poems[^131] – an
enterprise that was very much in tune with his own moment in Augustan
Rome. As Paul Allen Miller puts it, “\[t\]he creation of a private
poetry which ultimately engages the public realm, without becoming the
discourse of the state, requires the presence of… \[a\] set of social,
technological, and political conditions which separates Horace’s world
from that of his Lesbian predecessors.”[^132] This chapter will show how
Horace’s architexture reflects these particular “conditions” in the way
it redefines traditional lyric space and time to include extrageneric
(especially epic) material which might seem inappropriate or even
opposed to it.

This particular opposition between traditional lyric dimensions and the
extrageneric ones of epic is given concrete form in the *Odes* through a
specific juxtaposition of contrasting architectural structures. Horace’s
traditional lyric space-time is represented often by the figure of the
poet’s own Sabine farm[^133] – a modest dwelling from a simpler time
that seems perfect for housing the self-proclaimed Callimachean nature
of his lyric.[^134] In contrast to this humble structure of the poet
stands the excessively luxurious, expansive, and “modern” (cf.
*novo…ritu*, *C*. 3.1.45-46) villas of the Roman elite that appear in
many poems of the corpus but receive special attention in *C*. 2.18 and
3.1. Horace warns again and again against building such edifices: they
cause their owners, the poet implies, to lose a sense of the lyric here
and now – owners who are always off on some epic-like quest over the sea
to quarry stone from some far off land to show off one day in their
atriums, or perhaps constructing some monumental structure that (they
believe) will stave off their inevitable deaths. Through establishing
this set of opposing structures – the light, contained lyric farm of the
poet and the massive, transgressive epic estates of the wealthy – Horace
is able to establish the spatio-temporal limits of his *Odes* in a way
that seems “traditional” to his Roman readers, especially in how they
align with good old Roman *mores* regarding the luxury (or lack thereof)
in one’s own house.[^135]

Yet there is a problem with a simple dichotomy between Horace’s own
rural structure and those of the rich villa owners whom he criticizes:
this binary opposition does not appear, at least initially, to leave any
room at all for the famous architextural structure of the poet presented
in the finale to his first collection of *Odes*. There Horace proclaims
that the *monumentum* of his lyric poetry will soar “loftier than the
royal structure of the pyramids” (*regali*...*situ pyramidum altius*,
*C*. 3.30.2); more than that, the structure will exist outside of the
temporal boundaries that nature imposes on everything man-made through
its “decaying rain” and the “flight of ages” (*imber edax*...*fuga
temporum*, *C*. 3.30.3-5). Horace even goes so far as to state that
through his *monumentum* he “will not die completely” (*non omnis
moriar*, *C*. 3.30.6). How could the same Horace who tells his reader to
“forget about the pointless honors of a tomb” (*sepulcri* / *mitte
supervacuos honores,* *C*. 2.20.23-24) at the end of the previous book
suddenly turn around at the conclusion of Book 3 and claim to have
erected a *monumentum* grander than even the pyramids? All this is
suggestive of the mindset of those same villa owners whom he reprimands
throughout the *Odes* for forgetting the enjoyment of the lyric “here
and now.”[^136] It would appear, then, that at the very edge of his
lyric corpus Horace transgresses the boundaries established through his
own small estate and ventures into building an architextural structure
whose dimensions he formerly rejected as antithetical to his
lyric.[^137]

I argue in this chapter that this transgressive *monumentum* is in fact
the perfect symbol for Horace’s architexture. The “tension” found in the
*Odes* between the two opposed architextural styles of the farm and the
transgressive villa is not a problem to be solved, but rather is an
essential to the ultimate success of Horace’s redefinition of
“traditional” lyric. This tension is not an accident, moreover, but the
intended result of a rhetorical strategy that Horace uses repeatedly in
the *Odes* to introduce extrageneric material from epic into his lyric
without destabilizing its lyric foundations – a rhetorical device that I
call an “inverted” *recusatio* (“refusal”). The paradigmatic *recusatio*
involves a poet who is told by some divine figure not to write
epic.[^138] In Horace’s *Odes*, though, it is the poet *himself* who
often feels he has to restrain his Muse who has wandered off into very
non-lyric territory which the poet then describes at length. Through
this device, I suggest, Horace is able to offset the innovations he is
making to traditional lyric space and time through the inclusion of
extrageneric material in such a way that his structure remains stable
even as it is redefined – a process that Horace’s *monumentum*
represents perfectly in its own seemingly paradoxical ability to be both
stable and dynamic.

This chapter will be divided into four parts. The first will briefly
examine the Augustan *recusatio* with a view to the ways in which Horace
inverts the typical formula of the trope in his *Odes*, as well as his
potential reasons for doing so. The next part will deal with how Horace
uses this trope to bring extrageneric space and time in tension with the
lyric dimensions of his farm so as to revitalize while also altering the
structure of “traditional” lyric. The third part will turn to *C*. 3.30
to suggest that these tensions within the poet’s architexture are
represented there, as well, in a monument which is both more stable than
anything ever constructed and yet constantly changing. Finally, the
fourth part will explore how Horace’s redefinition of “traditional”
lyric in his poetry mirrors strategies employed by Augustus himself in
the *Res Gestae* to redefine the traditional structures of Rome, both
literal and metaphorical.[^139]

###Part 1. The Inversion of the *Recusatio* in Horace###

Although the *recusatio* was a common trope that many Augustan poets
employed to “extricate themselves from the expected imposition” to write
epics on the military exploits of Augustus,[^140] the rhetorical device
takes its cue from the programmatic opening of Callimachus’ highly
influential *Aitia*.[^141] In the prologue to that Hellenistic work the
narrator claims that Apollo himself appeared to him as he was about to
compose a poem. The god then told the poet that he should “raise \[his\]
sacrificial victim to be as fat as possible – but nurture \[his\] Muse
to be slender” (τὸ μὲν θύος ὅττι πάχιστον / θρέψαι, τὴ\]ν Μοῦσαν δ’
ὠγαθὲ λεπταλέην, *Aitia* fr. 1.23-24). And it was this particular
version of “divine intervention” that was then to establish the standard
formula for the *recusatio* which the Augustan poets would take up over
two centuries later at Rome: a divine being appears to the poet, forbids
him from engaging in epic flight, and suggests instead that he should
keep to light matters and meters.

The earliest full Latin example we have of such a *recusatio* appears in
Vergil’s *Eclogues* where it is a humble shepherd – as a stand-in for
the poet himself – who first sounds the strain of “refusal”:

> cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
> uellit, et admonuit: “Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
> pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen."
> nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
> Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
> agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam.
> non iniussa cano... (Verg. *Ecl*. 6.3-9)
>
> When I was starting to sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my
> ear, and warned me: “Tityrus, it is fitting for the shepherd to make
> his sheep fat, to utter a song finely spun.” Now I (and for there will
> be others, Varus, who will wish to tell your praises and compose poems
> about gloomy wars) will practice the rustic Muse on a slender reed.
> The songs I sing are not unordered...

The standard formula that begins with Callimachus is illustrated
perfectly here: the divine Apollo appears to the poet, tells him to
forget about epic, and advises that he focus instead on singing a
finely-spun song (cf. *oportet*...*deductum dicere carmen*, 5). As the
premier instance of the trope in surviving Latin poetry, it has been
argued, this Vergilian *recusatio* helped to cement the Callimachean
version as the prototype for Roman poets to follow.[^142]

In the poetry of Horace, however, there is something that seems off
about his “refusals,” for they do not seem to be proper refusals at all.
Steele Commager was right to assert that the Horatian *recusatio* is a
bit peculiar. “The *recusatio* was of course a common form,” Commager
begins, “but in Horace’s hands it usually becomes equivalent to the
rhetorician’s *praeteritio*.”[^143] In the introductory poem to his
Second Book of *Satires*, for example, Horace sets himself in dialogue
with an interlocutor who advises him that he *should* write epic only to
have Horace respond by declining the offer – all the while giving a
rather “descriptive catalogue”[^144] of those same epic themes that he
is disavowing:

> “...aut si tantus amor scribendi te rapit, aude
> Caesaris invicti res dicere, multa laborum
> praemia laturus.” “cupidum, pater optime, vires
> deficiunt; neque enim quivis horrentia pilis
> agmina nec fracta pereuntis cuspide Gallos
> aut labentis equo describit vulnera Parthi.” (Hor. *Sat*.
> 2.1.10-15)[^145]
>
> “Or if so great a love of writing snatches you, dare to utter the
> deeds of the unconquerable Caesar – and you will carry off many
> rewards for your labors.” “Though I desire it, my good sir, my
> strength fails me; for not just anyone at all can describe the battle
> lines bristling with spears, nor the Gauls dying when the points of
> their spears have been broken, or the wounds of a Parthian falling
> from his horse.”

This passage contains not only an “inversion” of the typical formula –
in that the one addressing the poet is actually *encouraging* him to
write epic – but also demonstrates how such an inverted *recusatio* can
offer the poet a chance to “commandeer his language from the subjects he
rejects.”[^146] In other words, the poet employs a catalog of epic
themes to give the reader the sense that he is more than adequate at
doing the very thing he professes that he cannot.[^147]

Horace’s *Odes* extends this function of the trope even further. The
poet inverts the procedure of the *recusatio* in a still more remarkable
manner by at times reprimanding his own Muse for overstepping the
boundaries of his lyric domain. In the introductory poem of *Odes* 2,
for instance, Horace starts by discussing the gloomy nature of Pollio’s
works on the civil wars; he reproduces so much epic-sounding material,
however, that the poet then feels compelled to “reel in” his own Muse
before he can end the poem,[^148] as the passage below demonstrates:

> Sed ne relictis, Musa procax, iocis
> Ceae retractes munera neniae,
> mecum Dionaeo sub antro
> quaere modos leuiore plectro. (Hor. *C*. 2.1.37-40)
>
> But lest you, my naughty Muse, take up again the rites of the Cean
> dirge leaving behind all jokes, seek measures on a lighter instrument
> with me within the cavern of Venus.

In this passage it is Horace himself – and not some divine being – who
instructs *his* Muse to behave herself and stick to light topics that
are more fitting for light meters. This is not the last glimpse we get
of Horace’s *procax* Muse, though. In Book 3 the poet again feels his
Muse has begun to slip out of his control after he has sung about a
council of the gods in which Juno delivers a lengthy (and epic-sounding)
prophecy for Rome. Here is the poet’s address to his Muse at the poem’s
conclusion:

> non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae:
> quo, Musa, tendis? desine pervicax
> referre sermones deorum et
> magna modis tenuare parvis. (*C*. 3.3.69-72)

> This will not be fitting for my playful lyre: where are you heading,
> my Muse? Intractable! Cease to report the speeches of gods and to
> diminish great things with your small measures.

In both of these passages it is not the usual divine being that comes to
Horace to turn him away from the epic mode; it is rather the poet
himself who confronts his Muse – not for inspiration, as one might
expect, but to restrain her from going into generic territory (cf.
*Ceae…neniae*; *magna*) which is unfitting for his light lyric poetry
(cf. *leviore plectro*; *iocosae…lyrae*; *modis… parvis*).[^149]

It should be clear by now what I mean by “inverted” *recusatio* when
comparing the Horatian art of “refusal” to the typical formula employed
by other poets. But why does Horace invert the trope in the first place?
What does the poet gain by transfiguring the *recusatio* formula in such
a way? Commager recognized the tension that such “refusals” produce, but
never fully resolved it. “Horace stands as the classic example,” he
writes,

> of the man who manages to eat his cake and have it too. Indulging the
> most extravagant of pastoral fantasies, he escapes charges of
> sentimentality; dispensing moral unction, he avoids the reproach of
> sermonizing; rising to an epic grandeur, he denies pretensions to
> sublimity; summoning all wealth’s sensuous reality, he receives credit
> for banishing it.[^150]

And the scholar ends his discussion of the tension there. Peter Smith
also left the matter of this “tension” only “partially solved” by his
own admittance.[^151] For Smith the tension is one that
(unsatisfactorily even to him) seems to be located within the historical
person of the poet himself: “in the *recusatio*, the slender poet had
shown an irresistible tendency to soar, for all his reticence. \[…\]
Though he had learned to live with the conflicting drives of self and
state, Horace was never altogether comfortable.”[^152] The main issue I
take with these approaches (besides the obvious biographical fallacy
which motivates Smith’s reading) is that they consider this “tension” to
be a problem which needs to be solved rather than a crucial component of
how Horace constructs his particular lyric structure, as I will suggest
below.

Gregson Davis, Michèle Lowrie, and Stephen Harrison have each attempted
in more recetn decades to provide a more nuanced approach to this same
tension through their respective studies on the rhetorical posturing of
Horatian lyric.[^153] Their answers focus on how Horace uses these
moments to introduce extrageneric material into his lyric poetry –
whether through what they term generic “assimilation,” “negation,” or
“enrichment,” respectively. Davis suggests that “the supposed aim of
‘refusal’ probably masks an intent to *incorporate*, rather than utterly
repudiate, matter traditionally regarded as alien to a particular
literary orientation,” with the result that Horace can then “assimilate”
other genres through disavowing their material.[^154] The idea of
“generic enrichment” that Harrison has put forth more recently does not
differ much from Davis’ understanding of these disavowels: “generic
enrichment,” as Harrison defines it, is “the way in which generically
identifiable texts gain literary depth and texture from detailed
confrontation with, and consequent inclusion of elements from, texts
which appear to belong to other literary genres.” [^155] Neither of
these scholars looks outside of Horace’s lyric world for the motivation
behind these rhetorical gestures.[^156] In contrast to these studies
Lowrie’s reading of Horace’s “disavowals” does extend beyond the poetic
implications and into the political realities of the Augustan age.
Although she also claims that Horace’s “poetry defines itself largely by
saying what it is not,” Lowrie convincingly argues that this
“tug-of-war…surpasses the formal conflict within the aesthetic realm, to
encompass that between aesthetics and ideology.”[^157] While Lowrie’s
approach does then help to show how Horace’s project of lyric definition
interacts with elements of Augustan ideology, it does not go deeper to
explore fully how the poet is also engaging with the very ways in which
that ideology was itself promoted[^158] – as it was through Augustus’
own *Res Gestae*, for instance, in the ways I will suggest in Part 4
below.

I would like to acknowledge at the outset that scholars have touched
obliquely upon a possible connection between the respective rhetorical
stances of the poet and the *princeps*.[^159] Karl Galinsky’s reading of
the repeated use of *recusatio* in the *Odes* probably comes closest to
some of the conclusions I arrive at in this chapter in that he also sees
the kind of rhetorical “refusals” that Augustus makes in the *Res
Gestae* as a source of indirect “inspiration” for the poet.[^160] The
scholar spends only a paragraph on this idea, however, and does not
fully develop the parallel. Nor does he look at what either Augustus or
Horace has to say about architecture in this context – which will be the
main focus of my comparison between the two at the end of this chapter.

Before I can discuss the nuances of this parallel, however, it will
first be necessary to work through the complex nature of Horace’s own
architexture in the *Odes*. The next two sections of this chapter builds
on the scholarship discussed above to ask not just *how* Horace defines
traditional lyric space and time, but also *why* he does it in the
precise way he does, that is, through a delicate balancing of the two
opposed architextural images of his farm and the transgressive Roman
villas he criticizes. It is by recognizing the importance of this
tension, I suggest, that one can better understand how Horace’s
*monumentum* in *C*. 3.30 is a perfect metaphor not only for his own
poems, but just as much for the age of redefinition in which he
constructs it – an age when the seemingly paradoxical idea that one
could redefine what was “traditional” became an important way for the
*princeps* to articulate what it meant to be Roman.

###Part 2. Transgressive Architexture in the *Odes*###

The latter half of Horace’s second book of *Odes* and the beginning of
the third contain several poems that discuss excessive architectural
structures. The focus of this section will be on the most extensive of
such discussions, namely, *C*. 2.18 and 3.1. Although Horace in these
poems might seem to portray grand, ostentatious architecture in an
unappealing light in contrast to his modest Sabine farm, it is by
claiming to disavow such transgressive structures that the poet is
actually able to make them a part of his traditional lyric space and
time. Let us start with the beginning of *C*. 2.18:

> Non ebur neque aureum
> mea renidet in domo lacunar,
> non trabes Hymettiae
> premunt columnas ultima recisas
> Africa, neque Attali 5
> ignotus heres regiam occupavi
>[…]
> …nihil supra
> deos lacesso nec potentem amicum
> largiora flagito,
> satis beatus unicis Sabinis. (*C*. 2.18.1-6, 11-14)

> An ivory and golden ceiling does not shine in my house, Hymettian
> beams do not press upon columns quarried from the ends of Africa, nor
> have I as the unknowing heir to an Attalus come in the possession of a
> palace \[…\] I bother the gods for nothing more, nor do I demand
> anything more lavish from my powerful friend, content enough as I am
> with my unique Sabine holdings.

This opening priamel should come as no surprise for readers of Horace:
not only is it an “imitation” of Bacchylides fr. 21;[^161] the theme of
excessively luxurious architecture should be rather familiar by the time
one reaches this poem near the end of Book 2.[^162] Horace has devoted
many lines already to criticizing such structures and the problems that
accompany them. In *Odes* 2.10, for instance, he warns against “halls
inciting envy” (*invidenda…aula*, 7-8). *C*. 2.15 begins with a lament
that “regal structures soon will leave a few acres for the plough” (*iam
pauca aratro iugera regiae* / *moles relinquent*, 1-2) – quite in
contrast to the traditional Roman way of life that the poet discusses in
the latter half of that poem (cf. *C.* 2.15.10-20). As Horace then notes
in *C*. 2.16, such structures only serve to make one more anxious with
all “the cares that flitter about paneled ceilings” (*curas laqueata
circum* / *tecta volantis*, 11-12). It should not be unexpected
therefore to find Horace ranting against such architecture at the
beginning of *C*. 2.18, as he relates all those trappings of luxury
which are *not* in his own house, including a ceiling of ivory and gold
(*ebur…aureum*…*lacunar*, 1-2), marble beams (*trabes Hymettias*, 3),
and columns quarried from the ends of Africa (*columnas ultima recisas*
/ *Africa*, 4-5).

It is not just the luxury itself that is the problem, however, as much
as the excessive and *transgressive* nature of building such a “palace”
(*regiam*, *C.* 2.18.6).[^163] Taking marble from a distant locale is
not the only way that these villa owners seek to extend their boundaries
across and beyond natural boundaries.[^164] The poet goes on to accuse
the rich of “greedily tear\[ing\] down the boundary stones of \[their\]
land and leap\[ing\] beyond the borders of \[their\] clients” (*revellis
agri terminos et ultra* / *limites clientium* / *salis avarus*, *C*.
2.18.24-26); even worse, these avaricious individuals desire to extend
their villas so as “to drive back the shores of the sea, being too
little rich themselves since the shore restrains them”
(*maris*...*summovere* *litora*, / *parum locuples continente ripa*,
*C*. 2.18.20-22, cf. *C*. 3.1.34-38). Both of these actions are examples
of what Ellen Oliensis has called a “debauched imperialism” in which
“formal, spatial, and moral boundaries all give way at once”[^165] – not
to mention natural and social ones.[^166]

What scholars have paid less attention to here are the generic
boundaries being crossed with the specific and marked image of extending
one’s villa into the sea – a space in the *Odes* which has often been
read as “a recurrent image for unsettledness and danger.”[^167] The
various reasons to sail on the sea – for trade, for making money, for
expanding one’s power – all present values that oppose the quiet life of
*autarkeia* that Horace imagines for himself in several poems of the
collection,[^168] including the very first one with its famous opening
priamel (cf. *C.* 1.1.11-14). As the reader learns only shortly later in
*C*. 1.3, moreover, the very act of sailing is a “crime” (*nefas*, 26)
against the natural order of things: “The prudent god divided the lands
from the discordant Ocean in vain, if impious ships still sail over
waters that are not to be touched” (*nequiquam deus abscidit* / *prudens
Oceano dissociabili* / *terras, si tamen impiae* / *non tangenda rates
transiliunt vada*, 21-24). Horace even goes so far in that poem as to
associate sailing with other famous acts that defy the natural
limitations of man, including Promethean thefts, Herculean journeys to
the underworld, and precarious Daedalean flights (cf. *C.*
1.3.27-36).[^169] From almost the very start, then, the sea in the
*Odes* comes to represent a space beyond the limits imposed on all
mortals.

But the borders that Horace is working out in *C*. 1.3 are not just
related to natural limitations of man; rather, as the famous addressee
of the poem would suggest, these bounds of nature are also meant to
represent the generic boundaries that are being crossed in that poem, as
well as in several others of the collection.[^170] The poet in *C* 1.3
is wishing his good friend Vergil a safe journey to Athens. That is what
the poem claims on its surface, at least. It is hard, however, not to
understant this *bon voyage* as having more to do with Vergil’s work on
the epic *Aeneid* than a simple trans-Adriatic crossing.[^171] Indeed,
as Michael Paschalis has put it, the “open sea space” in the *Odes*
functions as “a metaphor or metonym...for non-lyric (‘grander’) genres
and themes,” such as epic poetry.[^172]

The generic implications of this trope likewise appear in several other
poems in the first and second books of the *Odes*. In the famous Soracte
Ode, for example, Horace advises his companion to “entrust everything
else to the gods who have now calmed the warring winds on the seething
surface of the sea” (*permitte divis cetera, qui simul / stravere ventos
aequore fervido / deproeliantis*, *C*. 1.9.9-11) – the stormy sea having
no place within the intimate lyric atmosphere of Horace’s private
space.[^173] This idea is then made even more explicit in *C*. 1.14,
where the fragile ship which Horace addresses has rightly been read as a
representation of his poetry: it is a craft whose parts “creak”
(*gemant*, *C*. 1.14.6) and lines are shred (cf. *non tibi sunt integra
lineta*, 9), certainly no match for the harsh waters and “winds”
(*ventis*, 15) of epic.[^174] One can similarly interpret *C*. 1.34 and
the poet’s aborted sea journey into “epic” territory in that poem.[^175]
In Book 2 itself, moreover, traditional lyric space is repeatedly carved
out in contrast to those who wish to seek out the deep even when there
are storms on the water (*C*. 2.10.1-3), or those who find themselves
trapped in the wide open sea when rough weather has suddenly befallen
them (*C.* 2.16.1-4).[^176] By the time a reader gets to *C*. 2.18,
then, the act of entering the open sea is not only an established trope
for crossing boundaries; it is a generically charged action, as well,
when read in juxtaposition with several poems in Books 1 and 2 of the
*Odes*.

What then should a reader make of those who build villas that transgress
the maritime boundaries of the natural world – who literally “drive back
the shores of the sea” (*maris…* / *summovere litora*, *C*. 2.18.20-21)
through their constructions? Such builders are clearly engaging in an
ambitious undertaking that would seem rather out of tune with the
traditional lyric space that Horace delineates for himself, that is, a
space which seems completely opposed to the extension of boundaries,
whether physical, natural, or generic, as I will suggest below in the
figure of his Sabine farm. Bad as all this is, though, such architecture
in *Odes* 2.18 not only transgresses the spatial bounds of “traditional”
lyric, but the temporal ones, as well:

> tu secanda marmora
> locas sub ipsum funus et sepulcri
> immemor struis domos
>
> […]
>
> Nulla certior tamen
> rapacis Orci fine destinata
> aula divitem manet
> erum. Quid ultra tendis? (*C*. 2.18.17-19, 29-32)
>
> At the very footstep of death you contract marble to be cut and
> unmindful of the tomb pile up houses. […] Nevertheless, when the
> territory of rapacious Death has been reached, no palace more surely
> awaits the rich master. Why do you strive further?

While the rich go beyond the physical limits prescribed by man and
nature in extending their homes across boundary stones and even into the
sea, respectively, there is also the suggestion here that in doing so
they no longer have any concern for death (cf. *sub ipsum funus
sepulcri* / *immemor struis domos*, 18-19), especially in their apparent
belief that what they build will protect them from its
inevitability.[^177] According to Ellen Oliensis, in fact, the rich man
in this passage is actually “seek\[ing\] to postpone the temporal
*finis* of death by expanding the *fines* of his property.”[^178] Yet it
does not matter what kind of building you erect for yourself; when you
are dead, the poet warns, “no palace more surely awaits the rich master”
(*nulla certior…* / *aula divitem manet* / *erum*, 29, 31-32).[^179] The
greedy aristocrat has lost sight of the lyric “here and now” in his
desire to extend his building activities further past all boundaries,
temporal as well as spatial, and seek the sort of immortality more
befitting an epic hero who will be kept alive in song. It seems that it
is all for naught, though. All Horace can do is to ask such misguided
men a version of a question that he asks in reprimanding his naughty
Muse, namely, “why do you stive further” (*quid ultra tendis*,
32).[^180]

In contrast to this excessive, seemingly unlimited drive of such
architecture to transgress boundaries, both spatial and temporal, stands
Horace’s own “unique Sabine holdings” (*unicis Sabinis*, *C*. 2.18.14).
There is not much to say about Horace’s country abode, however, since
the structure (rather conspicuously) bears no architectural description
for a poem largely devoted to detailed accounts of architecture.[^181]
It is almost as though the Sabine farm has left no imprint on nature at
all. And that might be part of the point: Horace’s farm blends into the
landscape, not extending further than it should, not overstepping the
bounds of nature.[^182] The humble structure serves, according to Paul
Allen Miller, as “the symbol of his acceptance of the limits of
mortality on normal human existence,” as well as “a symbol of Horace’s
poetry, of his satisfaction with his lot in life.”[^183] It is very
different, in other words, from the transgressive structures that fill
the rest of the poem and several of those in Book 2 – structures whose
owners unlike Horace are never “happy enough” (*satis beatus*, *C*.
2.18.14) with what they already have at the present moment.

It might seem, then, that for Horace architecture which seeks to go
beyond the boundaries of lyric space and time achieves nothing in the
end – and certainly does not adhere to his traditional lyric principles
of design.[^184] Such architecture is not just ostentatious; more
importantly, it is *transgressive*, spatially as well as temporally. And
the first poem of Book 3 elaborates further on this idea:

> …somnus agrestium
> lenis virorum non humilis domos
> fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
> non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
> desiderantem quod satis est neque
> tumultuosum sollicitat mare
>
> […]
>
> quodsi dolentem nec Phrygius lapis
> nec purpuratum sidere clarior
> delenit usus nec Falerna
> vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
> cur invidendis postibus et novo
> sublime ritu moliar atrium?
> cur valle permutem Sabina
> divitias operosiores (*C*. 3.1.21-26, 41-48)

> Gentle sleep does not despise the humble houses of rustic men and the
> shady riverbank, nor is the valley of Tempe disturbed by storm winds.
> The tumultuous sea does not bother the man desiring what is enough.
> \[…\] But if Phrygian stone does not soothe a grieving man, nor
> wearing purple more brilliant than a star, nor Falernian wine or
> Persian perfume, why should I construct a lofty atrium in a new style,
> with doorposts that incite envy? Why should I exchange my Sabine
> valley for riches more full of worries?

The imagery here should be familiar by now to a reader of the *Odes*
after all the warnings against the dangerous sea and luxurious
architecture in the first two books. The tumultuous sea (*tumultuosum…
mare*, 26) is of no concern to simple, “rustic” (*agrestium*, 21) men
like Horace who inhabit “humble homes” (*humilis domos*, 22), only
“desiring what is enough” (*desiderantem quod satis est*, 25).[^185]
After all, a grieving man cannot be helped by what such exploration can
bring back, whether it be wealth, or the marble columns, purple dye,
wine, and perfume that accompany it (41-45). What is the point, the poet
therefore asks, of building a grand structure in a new style
(*novo…ritu*, 45-46) – one that is designed with doorposts that will
just incite envy (*invidendis postibus*, 45) and a lofty hall
(*sublime…atrium*, 46) whose very height could only serve to cause one
concern?[^186] In contrast to all this “modern” architecture once again
stands Horace’s own lowly farm, or rather – in a way that calls even
less attention to its actual physical structure – his “Sabine valley”
(*valle…Sabina*, *C.* 3.1.47).[^187] According to the poet, at least,
that is all he needs to be content.

Is he actually content, though? Horace spends quite a bit of time, as we
have seen, describing the excessiveness of villa architecture in the
*Odes* – so much time, in fact, that Eleanor Leach has seen some of
these poems as “virtually a celebration of luxury.”[^188] If Horace has
such great contempt for these structures, why then does he devote so
many poems and lines to describing them and relatively so little to the
description of his own modest farm? I will return to that question
momentarily. It is important, though, to understand that – as with the
architectural rants in Book 2 – personal luxury here is not the only, or
even most important, referent.[^189] There is a sense that the excessive
villa and the humble farm combine to form a kind of generic discourse;
they are architextural, in other words, to use the terminology put
forward in this dissertation.[^190] Nor has the metapoetic nature of
these structures escaped scholars of the *Odes*. Riemer Faber has
correctly suggested, for instance, that “\[j\]ust as the Sabine estate
represents a lifestyle and literary aesthetic that contrasts with
greater wealth associated with a more ambitious form of poetry, so too
the preceding clause, in 3.1.45-46, may be read as literary
discourse.”[^191] According to Faber’s argument, *C.* 3.1 in particular
is about the pressures of joining “private, non-political life and
personal poetry to public, national, and political poetry.” It is not
that Horace is unable to do so, Faber claims, but rather that he is
“express\[ing\] the difficulty he has in uniting them.”[^192] Horace
cannot escape the public spotlight, the argument runs, and its trappings
of wealth and grandeur cannot but find their way into his private lyric.

Even if one were to forgive the biographical fallacy to which this view
runs dangerously close, Faber’s conclusion nevertheless does not seem to
give Horace enough credit, especially if one considers more closely the
nuanced rhetorical stance that the poet is taking in these odes on
architecture. The constant attention to transgressive architecture does
not necessarily mean that Horace is having “difficulty” fitting it
together with his traditional lyric mode as represented by his modest
farm. The previous section introduced the idea of the inverted
*recusatio* in the *Odes* for poems in which Horace reprimands his Muse
for transgressing the limits of his lyric. This allowed the poet, I
argued, to integrate extrageneric material from epic into his poem while
actively disavowing it. A similar interpretation can be applied to his
architextural images of excess and their owners in the poems examined in
this section: it is not that the poet has trouble incorporating the
grand, public, political mode into his humble, private, personal lyric;
rather, on the contrary, he is able to do just that *through* claiming
to renounce the former.

For this technique to be effective, however, it requires a delicate
balancing of the two sides. It is no wonder, then, that Horace spends so
many lines on villas that try to extend beyond boundaries of traditional
lyric space and time, of the lyric “here and now,” in contrast to so few
on his own farm. Horace can easily establish his “traditional” lyric
space and time through the mere mention of his Sabine farm; the space
automatically has the poet’s stamp of approval because it is Horace’s,
after all, and Horace is a lyric poet. The Sabine farm does not need
much therefore to authorize it as a symbolic architextural structure for
Horace’s lyric. To introduce the opposing extrageneric material is a
different matter: the poet needs to give more attention to that which he
claims to disavow – as is common in the “inverted” *recusatio* trope –
so that it too can be become established in his poetry, even while
Horace appears to reject it as another’s prerogative. Too much
description of his farm would throw this tension out of balance. Too
little about the transgressive villas, on the other hand, and the reader
might miss the point – just as too much discussion of them would make
Horace seem insincere in his rejection of them. The balance has to be
just right, in other words, for the tensions to be weighed appropriately
so that the boundary of “traditional” lyric space and time that
separates the two can remain stable.

Michèle Lowrie interprets Horace’s apparent “crossing \[of\] the limits
he has established” as “serv\[ing\] a definitional purpose” for his
poetics. While that interpretation is not incorrect, I do not agree with
Lowrie’s conclusion that the poet is “mov\[ing\] from an initial
limiting gesture, to an expansive one, back to a compromise between the
two.”[^193] Horace is not entirely disingenuous in his injunctions
against such transgressive structures. The function of the inverted
*recusatio* is to make it possible, I would argue, for Horace to avoid
choosing either the lyric farm or the “epic” architecture of
contemporary villas – or even to have to make a “compromise” between the
two, as Lowrie suggests it. That does not mean Horace is employing the
inverted *recusatio* trope here because he is non-committal, or because
he wants to “eat his cake and have it too,” as Commager remarked.[^194]
Maintaining this tension is in fact essential to Horace’s redefinition
of traditional lyric space and time: it serves to *reinforce* the
stability of traditional lyric boundaries, even as they are redefined,
in such a way that Horace can revitalize the structure without
destabilizing its foundations.

To undertand this complicated dynamic it might be helpful to turn to the
theories of the 20^th^-century Russian semiotician Juri Lotman. In his
*The Structure of the Artistic Text*, for example, Lotman argues that
the “violation” of a structure can often catalyze the “informational
activization” of that very same structure. In the case of an “artistic
text,” in fact, the text

> does not merely represent the implementation of structural norms, but
> their violation as well. It functions in a dual structural field
> consisting of the tendency to establish order and to violate it.
> Although each tendency tries to dominate and destroy the opposing one,
> the victory of either would prove fatal to art. *The life of an
> artistic text depends on their mutual tension*.[^195]

The inclusion of extrageneric time and space through an inverted
*recusatio* does not destabilize the generic boundaries of “traditional”
lyric that are established through Horace’s Sabine farm; rather, as
Lotman suggests, the tension created helps to activate, or revitalize,
the traditional structure of Horatian lyric – and, more importantly, to
keep it “alive” and dynamic. The poet’s statements about his farm gain
meaning and definition, in other words, from the contrast between it and
the transgressive nature of the other architextural images in the
*Odes*, and *vice versa*. The tension that is thus produced by the
rhetorical figure of the inverted *recusatio* is not deleterious to the
traditional boundaries of lyric but instead allows both sides of the
spectrum to exist within Horace’s lyric structure – in tension, yes, but
equally balanced in such a way as to keep the boundary between the two
sides stable.

The tension discussed in this section between the two architextural
extremes is therefore integral to *stabilizing* the structure of
“traditional” lyric even while adding what might seem to be hostile to
it. This notion of balanced tensions leading to stability and new life
can also help account for the tensions that exist in Horace’s most
famous architextural image: his *monumentum* that concludes his first
collection of *Odes*. It is in fact the tension within his poetry as
brought out by the contrast between Horace’s farm and transgressive
architecture analyzed in this section that enables Horace to create a
structure that is stable enough to overcome death and yet dynamic enough
to always be “fresh” (*recens*, *C*. 3.30.8).

###Part 3. *Exegi Monumentum*…###

In *C*. 2.10, the very ode in which Horace famously introduces the idea
of the “golden mean” (*aurea mediocritas*, 5), the poet claims that
“high towers fall with a greater crash” (*celsae graviore casu* /
*decidunt turres*, 10-11). By so far as architecture departs from the
natural bounds of space and time, the poet seems to be saying, to that
degree it will tumble into ruin. Where does that leave Horace’s own
rather impressive monument that he imagines in *C*. 3.30? How does
*that* fit into this picture when it seems to contradict so blatantly
the kind of traditional lyric space and time symbolized by Horace’s farm
when contrasted to the transgressive villas discussed in the previous
section?[^196] Indeed, Horace’s *monumentum* seems to transgress the
very boundaries of his traditional lyric structure in an even more
extreme manner than any structure which he criticizes previously in the
*Odes*, as the beginning of the poem demonstrates:

> Exegi monumentum aere perennius
> regalique situ pyramidum altius,
> quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens
> possit diruere aut innumerabilis
> annorum series et fuga temporum.
> non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei
> vitabit Libitinam: usque ego postera
> crescam laude recens… (*C*. 3.30.1-8)

> I have completed a monument more lasting than bronze and loftier than
> the royal structure of the pyramids, which neither the decaying rain
> nor the powerless north wind could up-root – or even the innumerable
> series of years and flight of ages. I will not die entirely, and a
> great part of me will avoid death: constantly I fresh will grow by
> posterity’s praise…

This poem has been interpreted in a number of ways to account for the
apparent contradiction between such a monument that completely
transgresses the laws of nature and the earlier injunctions against the
kind of architecture in Books 2 and 3 that does just that. Neville
Collinge tries to solve the tension by considering that the poem is
simply “diffident in tone” and not entirely serious.[^197] Don Fowler
suggests, on the other hand, that the lack of “restraint” in the finale
to the *Odes* is representative of a hidden “guilty will to power” on
the part of Horace – that the poet simply could not help but make such
grand claims living in the regime that he does.[^198] Matthew Santirocco
represents perhaps a middle position between these two approaches,
arguing that while the poem might be “a bit self-deprecatory” the
“pride” which Horace feels is genuine; in fact, according to Santirocco,
the poem reveals a desire on the part of the poet to establish himself
in such a way that he would become “to poetry what Augustus is to the
state.”[^199]

**Augustan monument (La Turbie, France)**

<br>

I will explore the implications of this parallel between Augustus and
Horace in the final section of this chapter. It is first necessary,
though, to show how the architextural *monumentum* here is perhaps the
perfect symbol for the kind of lyric that the poet has constructed in
his *Odes*. Although it is transgressive to the highest degree, the
*monumentum* is built just like the traditional lyric structure that
Horace constructs, that is, through a balancing of tensions in such a
way that the monument too can be more stable than anything ever built
and yet eternally dynamic at the same time.[^200]

The first five lines of the poem present the *monumentum* as a structure
that clearly transgresses both temporal and spatial boundaries of
Horace’s lyric here and now.[^201] From a temporal standpoint the
monument will survive longer than the longest-lasting metal that
humankind can work.[^202] Nor will it be affected by the physical limits
of nature as represented by the “decaying rain” (*imber edax*, 3) and
the now “powerless” wind (*impotens*, 3); even more impressively, it
will exist outside of the eternal cycling of seasons (cf.
*innumerabilis* / *annorum series et fuga temporum*, 4-5).[^203] In
terms of spatial excess, moreover, Horace’s monument will be “loftier
than the regal structure of the pyramids” (*regalique situ pyramidum
altius*, 2).[^204] All this suggests that the *monumentum* of the poet
would be perhaps the most stable structure ever constructed in its
ability to resist those forces – gravity and time – that ultimately
destroy all works crafted by humankind.

Yet the monument is at the same time shown to be dynamic. It might well
seem odd at first that Horace says he will “grow” (*crescam*, 8) from
the praises of posterity. As scholars have suggested, however, the
imagery here is not inappropriate since the poet and his lyric
*monumentum* have “imperceptibly” become one and the same by this point
in the poem.[^205] But then the question becomes: “How can a stable
monument grow?” This is an issue that has spurred some interesting and
highly subtle interpretations. Whereas Michael C. J. Putnam argues that
“growth retaining continued freshness, eternity imposed on futurity…only
certifies the initial programme of a *monumentum* espousing stature
beyond space and time,”[^206] Michèle Lowrie suggests that “image of a
breathing monument” is able to avoid “the stasis of formalism” because a
“*monumentum* (monument, reminder, tomb, literary corpus) is not only a
piece of architecture, but a speech act.”[^207] It would seem, however,
that these scholars are overlooking the straightforward way in which
Horace’s *monumentum* is figured in an explicitly physical sense: it has
materiality (*aere perennius*, 1); it has physical dimensions
(*regalique situ pyramidum altius*, 2).[^208] The poet is employing the
idea of the monument here, I would argue, because monuments offer a
tangible feeling of stability that gives their viewers a sense of surety
against the forces which affect all mortals. The notion that this
*monumentum* can overcome those forces does not make it less physical;
if anything, in fact, Horace’s structure is a monument, *par
excellence*, in its ability to endure past all bounds. If this is the
case, though, then there would certainly seem to be a real tension here
between the stability that Horace’s *monumentum* as a monument promises
and his prophecy that it will be eternally dynamic.[^209]

That very tension is the point, however. It makes sense for Horace’s
architextural monument to be both stable and dynamic,[^210] for it
represents a poetics that is itself based on tensions that allow the
poet to stabilize traditional lyric space while he redefines it. I have
argued in this chapter that Horace “inverts” the *recusatio* in order to
construct his generic boundaries so that he can incorporate generic
tensions into its very structure without causing it to crack at the
foundations, that is, to create a stable lyric structure that can remain
traditional while still being innovative. That might seem paradoxical –
just as a monument that is stable and yet grows also might appear
paradoxical. This is not paradox for the sake of paradox, though, or
some kind of deconstructive dark humor for that matter. It is precisely
*because of* the incorporation of these mutual tensions through the
poem’s opposed architextural images that I have suggested Horace’s
poetry can achieve a dynamic enough nature to be *simultaneously* old
and new, traditional and innovative.[^211]

The use of such tensions can be found outside of Horace’s *Odes*, as
well. The remaining part of this chapter will suggest that understanding
how Horace constructs his *monumentum* can also inform one’s reading of
the tensions within the rhetoric of monumentality in the Augustan age
more broadly.[^212] It is because Horace’s *monumentum* does not
represent a compromise but rather a delicate balancing of tensions that
makes Horace’s *Odes* into a true Augustan monument, that is, one which
is stable *and* dynamic,[^213] one which able to signify past tradition
and present innovation at the same time.

###Part 4. Horace’s Augustan Monument###

In her book on *Horace and the Rhetoric of Authority*, Ellen Oliensis
argues that the poet’s lyric poetry

> with its multiple articulations and recurrent arrests, tends to
> concentrate...on *fines.* \[...\] And *yet* it is just this emphasis
> on limit that lends Horatian lyric an “imperial” character. The
> peculiar energy that charges Horace’s lyric *fines* both derives from
> and feeds a larger cultural preoccupation with the masterful
> articulation of space.[^214]

This “cultural preoccupation” is of course a reference to what Augustus
himself was doing to the structure of Rome – the physical one as well as
the one in the Roman imagination. The *princeps* was pushing the borders
of the empire farther than ever before. If Rome keeps growing and
incorporating more and more land and peoples, though, how can Roman
identity remain stable? That is an important question, no doubt, and one
that may have entered the minds of those living under Augustus amidst so
much change. Yet the physical borders of the empire were not the only
ones that were being redefined. At the same time, and more pertinent to
the focus of this dissertation, Augustus was redefining the structure of
the *res publica*, too, and incorporating into it ingredients and roles
that were very different from those of the Roman state during its rise
to power. Could Rome still remain “Rome” in the midst of so much
redefinition of its boundaries, outwards as well as from within its
*fines*?

Chapter II demonstrated just how important architecture was to the
Romans’ conception of the world around them and, in particular, to the
way that they saw their state. Yet the old structure of Rome was simply
that, old, and it had fallen into ruin – at least, according to Horace
himself, when he laments that Rome’s own architectural structures had
fallen into disrepair during the civil wars, and with them so had the
Roman state and its *mores*.[^215] Coming to this particular situation
Augustus needed to rebuild Rome, the idea of it as much as its physical
appearance. For this monumentalization of the city to be successful,
however, it had to be connected to the foundations of Rome’s past.
Augustus could not simply disregard the old structure of the republic,
in other words, even as he built his new one in the form of the
principate.

This chapter has teased out some of the nuances of Horace’s rhetorical
strategies in his attempt to redefine “traditional” lyric dimensions
through a balancing of tensions. It is interesting (and perhaps even
illuminating) to see what this approach can tell us about the careful
words that the *princeps* used to articulate his own revitalization of
traditional Roman “structures” in the *Res Gestae* through a similar
balancing of tensions. The Augustan program needed to be traditional and
yet new, republican and yet imperial. The *princeps* protests, too, in
favor of the traditional structures upon which Rome had been founded. At
the same time – and just like Horace – by keeping old and new systems in
subtle tension with each other he simultaneously integrates into these
structures a novel system of power without outwardly appearing to
destabilize the old foundations; if anything, in fact, it allows the
*princeps* to revitalize them, even as he introduces dramatic changes to
the republican structure.[^216]

There are numerous sections in the monumental inscription of the *Res
Gestae* where a reader can find Augustus refusing to accept novel honors
and titles. In *RGDA* 6, for example, Augustus claims that he “did not
receive any magistracy offered against the custom of his ancestors,”
even though it was what he claims the senate and Roman people wanted for
him.[^217] This comes at the end of a long list of “*res non gestae*”
which – according to Walter Eder – “serve\[s\] only to profile the
*princeps* as the incorruptible guardian of tradition who took care,
even against the will of Senate and People, not to contradict the
constitution of the fathers.”[^218] That seems to be correct, at least
on the surface. But it would also seem that if Augustus constantly goes
against the will of the Senate and People he is making just as much of a
statement about his power and its innovative nature. He neither needs
nor desires honors such as the consulship (or worse the dictatorship)
that represented the height of the republican *cursus honorum*.[^219]
And so he can “refuse” receiving them in an untraditional way. As Horace
with his ambitious builders transgressing the boundaries of his
traditional lyric time and space, so too Augustus with his subjects
offering to him what they should not. The transgression appears to be
all theirs, not his. By employing the rhetoric of the inverted
*recusatio* here – by being the active refuser of something seemingly
untraditional – the *princeps* is able to show his respect for past
traditions while simultaneously communicating that his new system no
longer requires them.

Refusing honors in this way was not the only manner in which Augustus
was successful in carefully articulating the transformation of Rome from
the old republic to the new principate through the use of an inverted
*recusatio*. The more significant examples for the purposes of this
chapter concern what Augustus has to say in his *Res Gestae* about his
own building program. The *princeps* lists several of his architectural
efforts in Chapters 19, 20, and 21,[^220] which is provided in its
entirety below for full effect:

I have cited the whole list here to demonstrate that while it might be
impressive in length and content the style in which Augustus talks about
his buildings is rather understated. For all the structures he claims to
have built (*feci*), rebuilt (*refeci*), or completed (*perfeci*), there
is almost no description of them – of their height, of their material,
or of really anything specific about their quality. He does mention
their costs a few times, but their physical nature as buildings is
dramatically underplayed. There is certainly nothing too explicit in his
language about how their impressive quality has increased the *maiestas*
of Rome, as Vitruvius claims in the preface to his *De architectura*
analyzed above in Chapter II.[^221]

This passage is certainly in keeping with the at times rather
undescriptive language of many an inscription.[^222] And anyone reading
in Rome, at least, would of course have the physical buildings
themselves at which to marvel.[^223] However, the way that Augustus
simply lists, without much detail at all, the structures that
contributed to the incredible transformation which he has brought about
to the city of Rome seems almost *too* modest, especially when compared
to Augustus’ own famous boast recorded by Suetonius to have left Rome a
city of marble,[^224] or Strabo’s over-the-top praise of the Campus
Martius in Book 3 of his *Geography*,[^225] or even Vergil’s allusions
to the golden-roofed Capitoline temple in Book 8 of the *Aeneid*.[^226]
Augustus does mention amounts of gold and other materials elsewhere in
the inscription. At the end of Chapter 21 (cited above), for example, he
speaks of the donation of 100 million sesterces that he made, as well as
the 35,000 pounds of “crown-gold” that he “refused” to take from the
Italian colonies. Perhaps it should not be surprising, though, that
Augustus picks the end of his architectural deeds to insert these many
“refusals” to accept all the crown-gold offered to him: in the language
of the *Res Gestae* neither “heads” of Rome – that is, the Capitoline or
Augustus’ – are to be depicted with their respective golden crowns. To
depict them as such would be out of line with tradition.[^227] To show
restraint in his words and actions grants the *princeps*, on the other
hand, the opportunity to allude to the image of these novelties within
*Res Gestae* even while seeming to downplay or reject them. Augustus can
thus create a subtle tension in his *Res Gestae* that helps him to
articulate his new powers through the actions of others without going
outside the traditions of the past himself.

Augustus achieves this tension in other ways, as well, through his
building program itself. He does not merely build under his own name,
for instance, but often does so under that of another. In the most
telling example of this non-naming Augustus claims to have “renovated”
the Theatre of Pompey “without any inscription of my \[i.e., Augustus’\]
name” (*refeci sine ulla inscriptione nominis mei*, *RGDA* 20) – a
statement which receives additional emphasis from its placement after
the verb *refeci*.[^228] It is not restraint that compels Augustus to
behave in this manner. This “refusal” instead demonstrates that Augustus
does not need to use the republican tradition of inscribing buildings
with one’s name if he so chooses. Why? Because his power goes beyond
simple republican display. Inscribing every building with one’s own name
– that was part of Pompey’s and Caesar’s strategy, just as it was for
many a Roman aristocrat before them. It can be assumed that every Roman
knew exactly who was responsible for these buildings whether the name of
the *princeps* was there or not. Augustus stresses in this passage that
he has kept the physical structures of the past intact in his
reconstruction of the city; he goes out of his way, in fact, to
emphasize that he has repaired all the temples in Rome that needed it
(cf. *nullo praetermisso quod e*\[*o*\] *tempore* \[*refici
debeba*\]*t*, *RGDA* 20). By discussing this reconstruction as he does
in his *Res Gestae*, however, the *princeps* can show how these
structures take on new meaning under the principate, even if – or rather
*because* – he “refuses” to change their form, or add his name in place
of the original builder.

The *princeps* built more than anyone else has. That much is clear from
the lengthy passage cited above.[^229] His description does not stress
that he is building *differently* from his predecessors, however. And
the particular strategy of “refusal” that he employs here – whereby he
actively denies to himself the power or recognition that he has already
gained – should be familiar now from the above examination of Horace’s
*Odes* in this chapter. Indeed, as with the poet’s lyric, the genius of
Augustus’ redefinition of Rome was that his refusals to change it
actually allowed him to articulate that he had. The monumentalization of
Rome as described in the *Res Gestae* is conveyed not through blatant
statements of transformation, but rather in the implications that lie
behind, and are almost contradictory to, what his words claim in the
inscription. And like the poet Augustus used this tension to respect the
past – to redefine and revitalize Roman traditions – while
simultaneously constructing something new.

By thus reconstructing the traditional borders of Rome’s structure,
physically as well as metaphorically, the *princeps* could stabilize
what it meant to be a good traditional Roman while in some ways
dramatically departing from what it had meant in the republic. This is
only possible, however, because he has injected his architectural
discourse with a stabilizing tension between the new and the
traditional. Augustus does not have choose between what was conventional
and what was not: he can have both *simultaneously* by delicately
balancing them in tension with each other. The Augustan age was not just
a period in which Rome’s traditional structures were redefined; just as
important, it was also an age of redefining *how* one can define such
structures in the first place.

This chapter has demonstrated why the lyric *monumentum* in finale of
the *Odes* is perhaps the perfect architextural structure for
representing his first collection of lyric poetry. Horace builds up the
tensions on which it is based from the start – transgressive structure
by transgressive structure, inverted *recusatio* by inverted
*recusatio*. The tensions that emerge in contrasting his Sabine farm to
these transgressive structures allowed him *both* to establish a
“traditional” structure for his lyric *and* to bring novel material
inside of it. This rhetorical strategy should not be seen as deceitful
in some way: from the start Horace has been proclaiming – albeit through
“refusing” – his poetry’s innovative, dynamic nature from within its
“traditional” lyric bounds.

How does understanding the way that Horace builds his “monument” give us
insight into the architectural discourse of the monumentalization of
Augustan Rome? It might be tempting at first to suggest that in *C*.
3.30 Horace is in some way “exposing” and thereby subtly criticizing the
“delicate” nature of Augustus’ rhetorical strategy.[^230] But that
interpretation would suggest that the parallel is entirely intentional –
and, more importantly, quite limited in its aims. We can never know for
certain how conscious Horace was of the parallel, let alone whether he
meant it negatively.[^231] In his book on Augustan culture Karl Galinsky
has suggested a more nuanced way of understanding the sense of a “shared
direction” between the poet and the *princeps*:

> It would be futile to fall back on the schematic explanation that one
> man “influenced” the other or, worse yet, to relapse into the
> hierarchical model according to which Horace takes orders from
> Octavian. Rather, what we see here at an early stage, long before
> Augustus’ expanding *auctoritas,* is a sense of shared direction. Its
> elaboration is left to the inclination and creativity of the
> individuals. This accounts for another characteristic that the
> implementations of both Horace and Augustus have in common: neither is

> energies to surpassing the model and giving it a meaning of their own.
> It is a process that is profoundly characteristic of Augustan culture.
> \[…\] Horace, instead of being a mere imperial versifier, carries on a
> creative dialogue with the Augustan milieu. He reacts to some of its
> ideas and reshapes them in his own way. Above all, he is never
> passive.[^232]

One does not have to accept Galinsky’s seemingly all-encompassing idea
of *auctoritas* for his approach here to have validity. What we can
reasonably say given the findings of this chapter is that Horace’s
*Odes* taps into the rhetorical strategies of the Augustan age in which
a “refusal” to condone modifications to a traditional structures
actually granted existence to those same innovations as part of the
structure itself – innovations which in turn revitalized the structure.

Horace did not write an epic for the *princeps*. Nor did he need to. His
lyric *monumentum* is an especially fitting contribution to Augustus’
monumentalization of Rome: it represents for us the kind of claim
through architectural imagery that Augustus could not make explicitly
because to make it would in a sense disrupt the perfect balance of
republic and imperial power that the “refusals” themselves had already
allowed the *princeps* to assume. The poet could decide without too much
anxiety to build his immortalizing monument while alive. He had little
to fear (besides perhaps ridicule) by proclaiming his own poetic
“apotheosis” at the end of the first publication of his *Odes*. For
obvious reasons such was not the case for the *princeps*, who smartly
waited until after he died to let himself be deified in Rome. The point
is that Augustus did not have to say he would become immortal for it to
happen. And we can imagine that even without *C*. 3.30 much the same
could be said about Horace and his forever stable yet eternally dynamic
lyric *monumentum*.

[^120]: Harrison 2007a, 264, makes the generalizing but accurate
    statement that “as always with Horatian poems, structure is
    important.”

[^121]: See Collinge 1961, 129, claiming that “the collection must…be
    appraised as a structure of structure,” Dettmer 1983, and Santirocco
    1986, 174, where he concludes that Horace’s poems are “the
    individual stones out of which a single monumental edifice is
    constructed. Horace has woven, or built, so successfully, that his
    three books do not appear to be a medley of discrete poems but
    almost one large poem.”

[^122]: Whereas von Albrecht 1973, 67, claims that *C*. 3.30 is the
    *Schlußstein* (“keystone”) of the collection, Putnam 1986, 23,
    writes of the *Odes* that “the extraordinarily moving structure of
    their sum suggest a decisive awareness on Horace’s part of his
    poetic, and therefore of his intellectual and moral, design.”

[^123]: Davis 1991, 9.

[^124]: Cf. Hor. *C*. 3.30.1-2: *Exegi monumentum aere perennius* /
    *regalique situ pyramidum altius*. Hannah 2007, 165, goes so far as
    to suggest that *C*. 3.30 “contains the most sustained meditation on
    the relationship between poetical and architectonic *monumenta* in
    Roman poetry.” I will treat this poem at length below, pp. 74-79, as
    it represents one of the core architextural images of Horace’s
    *oeuvre*.

[^125]: On Horace and his “rivalry” with Catullus, in particular, see
    Segal 1969a, 246, maintaining that “Horace’s ode [i.e., *C*. 2.6]
    defines a mode of life totally antithetical to Catullan vehemence.
    Horace here shows himself in deliberate *aemulatio* with the
    greatest lyric poet yet produced in Rome, *trying to widen the scope
    of the lyric and redefine its boundaries*” (my emphasis).

[^126]: Lowrie 1997, 39. See also Paschalis 2002b, 71, claiming that
    “one of Horace’s major contributions to the shaping of ancient
    lyric…is his construction of lyric space,” and Harrison 2007b, 169,
    where he suggests that “the relative absence of prescribed
    content in ancient lyric is crucial…for an appreciation of the
    literary form of Horace’s *Odes*.”

[^127]: See Galinsky 1996 for analysis of how “tradition” in the
    Augustan age was often defined by the “restoration” of former
    mechanisms in tandem with the “innovation” of new ones – whether in
    its politics, its religion, its art, or its literature. Syme 1939,
    319, claims (from a less generous perspective perhaps) that in
    creating the principate Augustus “exploited with art and with
    success the traditional concepts and the consecrated vocabulary of
    Roman political literature.”

[^128]: I follow the very reasonable premise of Lowrie 1997, 49, that
    “lyric time is the *hic et nunc*.”

[^129]: Alcaeus, Sappho, Bacchylides, and Pindar, to name perhaps the
    most notable. See Paschalis 2002a for several essays which discuss
    Horace’s relationship to Greek lyric poetry.

[^130]: As I will note below in footnotes, where appropriate.

[^131]: Although Horace does claim to be the “Roman Alcaeus” (cf. Hor.
    *Epist*. 2.2.99-100), Feeney 2012, 12, points to *Epist*. 1.19 to
    suggest that “Horace does not say ‘I am the Roman Archilochus or the
    Roman Alcaeus’; he says ‘I am carrying on a tradition and recreating
    it just as they did.’ He claims to be like them, obviously, in
    important respects; but he is not their incarnation, or their
    equivalent or counterpart.” Indeed, according to Zetzel 1983, 87,
    “Horace…is combining Hellenistic and Roman elements in what is in
    fact a *radical transformation* of the lyric forms of early Greece”
    (my emphasis).

    1988, 197-260, and Santirocco 1995, 229-232.

[^133]: Cf. *C*. 2.16.37: *parva rura*; 2.18.14: *unicis Sabinis*;
    3.1.47: *valle…Sabina*. On the importance of Horace’s Sabine estate
    for his poetic vision see Pearcy 1977, 779, Leach 1988, 210-211,
    292-293, Miller 1991, 372-381, Leach 1993, Paschalis 2002b, 73,
    Faber 2005, Harrison 2007b, 113-114, and Armstrong 2009, 88-89.

[^134]: See Cody 1976, Fowler 1995a, 254, claiming that “one of the most
    distinctive features of Horace’s work is a union of Callimachean
    poetics with Epicurean stress on the simple life,” and Harrison
    2007a, 262: “Horace’s carefully crafted poetic style \[was\]
    fundamentally influenced by the Callimachean aesthetics of brevity,
    elegance and polish.”

[^135]: Nisbet and Hubbard 1978, 288, note that “\[t\]he Roman orators
    were fond of denouncing extravagance, particularly in building,” and
    cite Cato the Elder as an example (cf. Cato *or. fr.* 174, 185).
    Augustus also tried to cultivate such *mores* in his own “modest”
    house on the Palatine (cf. Suet. *Div. Aug*. 72-73). Whereas La
    Rocca 1986, 16-17, presents some of the archaeological findings on
    the *domus augustea*, which reveal it to be rather impressive, “like
    that of a Pergamene king” (*come quella dei re pergameni*), Edwards
    1993, 166-168, and Milnor 2005, 47-93, offer different
    interpretations of its complex meaning.

[^136]: Paschalis 2002b, 73: “\[T\]he lyric enjoyment of the here and
    now is incompatible both with temporal extension (i.e. commitment to
    the future) and with spatial expansion.”

[^137]: Something similar might be said in relation to the poem at the
    other “edge” of the corpus, namely, *C*. 1.1, where an opening (and
    lengthy) priamel which focuses on the sort of transgressive
    activities with which Horace does not want to associate himself ends
    up anticipating in a sense the poet’s own transgressive desire to
    “strike the stars with his lofty head” (*sublimi feriam sidera
    vertice*, 1.1.36). Since this poem does not have many explicit
    architectural references, it is outside the scope of this study. I
    would tentatively suggest, however, that *C*. 1.1 as a whole might
    itself be anticipating the entire rest of the first three books of
    the *Odes* in which the very sort of building activity that Horace
    seems to reject throughout is ultimately taken up by him in the
    finale in the form of his *monumentum*. See also Musurillo 1962 for
    further analysis of the end of *C*. 1.1.

[^138]: See pp. 54-55 (esp. n. 23) below for discussion and examples of
    the prototypical *recusatio*.

[^139]: My argument again is not so much interested in how Horace is
    engaging with the monuments of the Augustan age as it is in how he
    plays a part in creating the discourse surrounding monuments in
    general. For Horace’ interaction – or rather lack thereof – with
    actual Augustan monuments see Hardie 1993, 126, claiming that
    “\[o\]ne reason for Horace’s reluctance to evoke actual monuments in
    his verse is the desire to establish his own words as an
    alternative, and superior, kind of monument,” and Jaeger 1995, 191,
    where she argues that “\[b\]y circumventing the buildings to focus
    attention on the ephemeral and the permanent \[in *C*. 1.8\],
    \[Horace\] has celebrated the place while maintaining his own
    standards for his chosen genre.” Despite the lack of Roman monuments
    in Horace’s poems I find Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 26, to be right
    in suggesting that “Horace is the first poet who shows clear signs
    of being deeply affected by…changes in the experiential fabric of
    Rome,” especially given all the attention he bestows upon
    architecture throughout the *Odes*.

[^140]: See Lynn 1995, 31-32, where he notes that “\[g\]reat Roman
    military figures had expected and received epic poems on their
    military exploits” and goes on to list several of these works
    composed to celebrate the achievements of Julius Caesar. It even
    appears, according to Lynn, that the contemporary Roman poet
    Rabirius may have written an epic on the battle of Actium. See also
    White 1993, 81-82, suggesting that the *recusatio* was a means by
    which a poet could “disembarrass himself of the \[epic\] genre by a
    graceful sidestep.”

[^141]: For the tremendous influence of Callimachus on Augustan poetry
    see Wimmel 1960, Clausen 1964, R. F. Thomas 1983, R. F. Thomas 1993,
    Fantuzzi and Hunter 2005, 444-485, and now Acosta-Hughes and
    Stephens 2012, 204-269.

[^142]: In his concise survey of the Augustan trope of “refusal,” Lynn
    1995 goes so far as to suggest that “\[t\]he term ‘recusatio’ is
    best applied in the first instance to texts which follow our
    first-known example of the *topos*, Vergil *Eclogue* 6.3 ff., i.e.
    to texts which follow Vergil’s graceful and specific tactic in those
    lines” (32). Cf. Prop. 2.13.3-4: *hic* \[i.e. *Amor*\] *me tam
    gracilis vetuit contemnere Musas* / *iussit* (“Love forbade me to
    despise Muses of such grace”); 3.3.13-16: *...me Castalia speculans
    ex arbore Phoebus* / *sic ait aurata nixus ad antra lyra:* / “*quid
    tibi cum tali, demens, est flumine? quis te /  carminis heroi
    tangere iussit opus*?” (“...Apollo seeing me from the Castalian
    forest spoke in this way as he leaned on his gilded lyre near a
    cavern: ‘Are you crazy? What is your business with such a stream?
    Who ordered you to touch a work of heroic song?’”)

[^143]: Commager 1962, 112.

[^144]: Commager 1962, 113. Cf. Prop. 2.1.17-42 for an even longer
    catalogue of what the poet claims he cannot put into song.

[^145]: The Latin text of Horace’s poems is from Wickham 1901.

[^146]: Commager 1962, 114-115. See also Lynn 1995, 35-36, where he
    claims that “Horace evades the prospect of an epic on
    Octavian...with motifs that may be felt to recall and invert the
    ‘recusatio’, that indeed are funnier if they recall the
    ‘recusatio.’” For Lynn, however, Horace’s inversion of the trope
    seems merely for the sake of a “joke.”

[^147]: See Smith 1968, 57: “That the protests of deficient strength are
    ironical can be seen by their juxtaposition with passages that prove
    the ability and virtually fulfill the heroic request.”

[^148]: Johnson 1966, 273, argues that “\[t\]he meaning of this arrogant
    transparent irony is, of course: ‘I have distilled the essence of
    epics, tragedies, and histories into forty rather tasteful verses; a
    small thing, but my own.’” See also Davis 1991, 247, concluding that
    “\[a\]fter nine strophes of an ode that engages in the ‘sincerest
    form of flattery’ – quasi-involuntary imitation of the addressee’s
    grandiloquent matter and manner – the very speaker who has already
    stretched lyric norms in the poem encodes his audacious
    transgression in a closing apostrophe that both restores light lyric
    and defends the transgeneric *fait accompli*.”

[^149]: See Lowrie 1999, 41, arguing that “\[t\]he question to the Muse,
    *quo, Musa, tendis?* (70) uses the language of transgression and
    digression; she is going ‘out of bounds.’ The split between poet and
    Muse mirrors that between what Horace thinks lyric ‘should be’ and
    his actual poetry. He addresses her as if she were not the
    abstraction of his own poetic self, and underscores this
    self-difference with *pervicax* (70). The transgression is generic.”
    See also Harrison 2007b, 188, where he claims in analyzing the end
    of this poem that “\[t\]he epic elevation and serious tone achieved
    in this poem is thus explicitly marked as inappropriate for Horatian
    lyric poetry: ‘playful lyre’ suggests that these themes are too
    grand for the current generic context, and the Muse is rebuked for
    her supposed stubbornness in retailing material which is
    traditionally epic, the contents of divine councils (‘the speeches
    of gods’).”

[^153]: Davis 1991, Lowrie 1997, Harrison 2007b, 1-33, 168-205.

[^154]: Davis 1991, 5. As Davis goes on to claim, “an ancillary
    objective of many proclaimed ‘refusals’ is not to *exclude,* but,
    paradoxically, the opposite – to *include* generically disparate
    material while protesting vigorously against it” (28).

[^155]: Harrison 2007b, 1.

[^156]: The upshot of Davis 1991 is a thorough analysis of the complex
    “lyric self” that Horace crafts in his *Odes* and, in particular,
    how it is “constructed…often against the backdrop of generic others
    (epic, elegiac, or iambic).” While Harrison’s idea of “generic
    enrichment” is a useful and easily applicable tool for the study of
    Augustan literature as “the intergeneric form of intertextualism”
    (16), it does not seem to produce a substantial advancement – at
    least when it comes to the *Odes* – beyond the ideas of Davis 1991
    or Lowrie 1997.

[^157]: Lowrie 1997, 2, 4. For Lowrie, this “tug of war” exists between
    “lyric” and what she calls “narrative” – the latter of which “often
    goes hand in hand with content primarily associated with genres
    other than lyric (epic especially, but also elegy).”

[^158]: Lowrie 1997 does at several points discuss how Horace is almost
    “retailing” Augustus’ *Res Gestae*, especially in his Fourth Book of
    *Odes*, but she does not suggest that there is a parallel in the
    rhetorical techniques employed by the two authors.

[^159]: See Fowler 1995a, Santirocco 1995, Galinsky 1996, 257-258,
    Oliensis 1998, and Lowrie 2005 (in a logical development of Lowrie
    1997). Oliensis 1998, 132, is right to claim that “\[i\]n writing
    before the emperor, Horace uses various devices not only of tactful
    evasion but also of self-restraint,” even if she does not explicitly
    acknowledge that this “self-restraint” is also a part of the
    emperor’s own rhetoric. Santirocco 1995, 229-231, also analyzes the
    *Res Gestae* together with the *Odes*, even going so far as to say
    that “many of the literary strategies deployed in \[the *Res
    Gestae*\] appear frequently in Horace’s *Odes*” (230) – though he
    unfortunately does not specify exactly which ones he means.

[^160]: Galinsky 1996, 258. Although I came to the idea of a parallel
    between the rhetoric of Horace and Augustus independently of
    Galinsky, I find his approach to the idea of influence between the
    poet and the *princeps* very useful, as I will discuss below, pp.
    87-88.

[^161]: See Nisbet and Hubbard 1978, 287, and West 1998, 137, calling
    *C*. 2.18 a “motto” poem in that it takes its start from a Greek
    predecessor.

[^162]: In his survey of the figure of the “ambitious builder” in the
    *Odes*, Whitehorne 1969, 38, claims that the trope of excessive
    architecture is “a purely Roman invention” – even if he
    acknowledges, 29-30, that the trope as a symbol of social decay goes
    back as least as far as Demosthenes’ *Third Olynthiac*. See also
    Pearcy 1977, 772, arguing that “the image of the builder is one of
    Horace’s devices for defining the poet’s relation to society.”

[^163]: Cf. *C*. 2.15 in which – according to Pearcy 1997, 775 – “rich
    men’s villas, fishponds, and sterile gardens were set against the
    natural landscape as emblems of the unnatural society of Horace’s
    day.”

[^164]: Whitehorne 1969, 29, suggests that the 1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE Roman
    aristocrat Lucullus was “among the first to spend fortunes on his
    seaside villas and it was a Stoic, Aelius Tubero, who nicknamed him
    the ‘*Xerxes togatus*’” (cf. Vell. 2.33.4; Plut. *Luc*. 39.3).
    According to Whitehorne, moreover, the trope went on to provide
    Roman writers “with an extremely useful literary peg on which to
    hang a variety of ideas, concerned with *luxuria*, moral decadence
    and the place of man in nature and society.”

[^166]: See Pearcy 1977, 777: “His disregard for the natural limits is
    symbolized by his estate’s disregard for the limits of land and
    sea.”

[^167]: See Segal 1969a, 239, where in his analysis of *C*. 2.6 Segals
    goes on to claim that the “ever-seething sea” (cf. *semper* /
    *aestuat unda*, 3-4) stands in contradistinction to “the tilled,
    cared-for land where the poet will find rest.” See also Paschalis
    2002b, 77, arguing that the “open sea space becomes the space of
    anxiety and mental agitation... resulting from commitments
    diametrically opposed to those of lyric *bios*,” which is reflected
    primarily by small, interior spaces throughout the corpus; according
    to Paschalis, in fact, the open sea is “most commonly negatively
    marked and reflects values radically opposed to those of primary
    lyric space.”

[^168]: Cf. *C*. 1.34, 2.16.13-29, 3.1.21-32, 47-48, 3.19.

[^169]: See Zumwalt 1974, 458, claiming that “\[m\]an is confined first
    to earth, ultimately to the underworld. He cannot cross the set
    bounds of time and space.”

[^170]: The generic implications of this trope can be traced back to
    Callimachus, who concludes his *Hymn to Apollo* by comparing his
    light poetry – which “both pure and unpolluted springs upward from a
    holy fount trickling a little at a time the choicest of waters”
    (καθαρή τε καὶ ἀχράαντος ἀνέρπει / πίδακος ἐξ ἱερῆς ὀλίγη λιβὰς
    ἄκρον ἄωτον, 110-111) – to “the poet who sings however many things
    are of the sea” (τὸν ἀοιδὸν ὃς…ὅσα πόντος ἀείδει, 106) and whose
    poetry is like the “the mighty flow of the Assyrian river” (Ἀσσυρίου
    ποταμοῖο μέγας ῥόος, 108). See also Paschalis 2002b for how the open
    sea is a trope employed by the Greek poet Alcaeus (cf. fr. 208),
    even if to a much different effect from the way that Horace uses it
    in the *Odes*.

[^171]: See Santirocco 1986, 28-29, arguing that “Horace’s bon voyage
    for Vergil can…be understood as a reflection on the composition of
    the *Aeneid*.”

[^172]: Paschalis 2002b, 77. See also Anderson 1966, 91, and Santirocco
    1986, 75. Epic poetry is not the only generic referent possible for
    the open/stormy sea, however. The space can be a metaphor for
    violent erotic passion, as well, and thus a location suitable for
    more elegiac themes. In *C*. 1.5, for instance, the poet compares
    Pyrrha’s love to “harsh waters” (*aspera*...*aequora*, 5-6) for any
    inexperienced lover of hers. Vessey 1984, 486, argues that “Pyrrha
    herself, the golden Pyrrha, has the *gracilis puer* in her arms at
    the outset of a voyage that must prove disastrous to him, though not
    to her; neither she nor the sea ever changes or disappears. Only
    experience can teach her victims that all that glistens is not gold
    so that, soaked and buffeted by the waves of her perfidy, they at
    last retire from the life of love...” This interpretation has led
    some scholars – mistaking elegiac space for actual erotic
    circumstance – to see the ship in *C*. 1.14 as an allegory for a
    woman whom Horace is trying to dissuade from embarking on another
    amatory (mis)adventure. See Anderson 1966, Woodman 1980, and Knorr
    2006 in favor of this argument and Jocelyn 1982 for a critique of
    it. Murgatroyd 1995 provides a detailed survey of the “sea of love”
    trope in both Greek and Latin poetry.

[^173]: See Paschalis 2002b, 74-76, for analysis of *Odes* 1.9 with
    attention to Horace’s use of the open sea therein.

[^174]: Anderson 1966 was to first to consider seriously that Horace
    here might be referring to “poem-ship” – though he rejects this idea
    in the end because of “the simple fact that Horace separates himself
    from his ‘ship,’ whereas the poet and ship conventionally belonged
    together” (91). Zumwalt 1978-1979 builds upon this point and argues
    that the poet transfigures the allegory as the “Ship of Love Poetry”
    – a symbol for Horace’s “creative faculty as love or ‘light’
    lyricist” (250). It is lyric in general, however, and not lyric as
    love poetry that I would argue is the referent.

[^175]: Zumwalt 1974 provides a comprehensive analysis of *C.* 1.34,
    arguing that “Horace has sailed into forbidden poetic territory. He
    finds himself, perhaps, on the high sea, representing…grander
    themes, and is forced to retreat.”

[^176]: See Paschalis 2002b, 72, where in his analysis of *C*. 2.16 the
    scholar proposes that the poem “opposes the open space of stormy
    seas, war, and self-imposed exile, which are identified with the
    unrestrained impulse for the acquisition of wealth and power, to the
    restricted space of the speaker’s Sabine farm where he leads an
    untroubled life devoted to lyric *otium*.”

[^177]: Whitehorne 1969, 32-33, notes that “\[t\]he wealthy man is so
    intent upon contracting his work that he has lost touch with reality
    and has forgotten even the approach of death \[…\] The motif of
    excessive building acquires…the connotations of overflowing wealth
    and a hybristic desire to escape the fate that awaits all men.” See
    also Santirocco 1986, 105, where the scholar argues that “\[b\]y
    thus denying social and natural boundaries, the rich man seeks to
    deny his own mortality,” and Miller 1991, 377, claiming that the
    *avarus* “displays a failure to understand his own limits, since he
    is every bit as subject to death as the lowest slave (29-40).”

[^178]: Oliensis 1998, 110. See also Pearcy 1977, 781, stating that
    “\[e\]xtravagant architecture violates the limits of nature and
    betrays a misunderstanding of the inevitability of death.”

[^179]: Nisbet and Hubbard 1978, 307, *ad loc*., put it well in noting
    that the rich man “encroaches unnaturally on the sea, but the land
    will open up for him without any difficulty. He oversteps the
    boundaries imposed by nature and morality, but he himself will soon
    reach his limits.”

[^180]: Cf. *C*. 3.3.70: *quo*, *Musa*, *tendis*? See above, pp. 57-58,
    esp. n. 30, for an analysis of this passage from Book 3.

[^181]: Leach 1988, 231, aptly notes that “\[t\]he least of Horace’s
    concerns is to inform his reader of the actual particularities of
    the farm” – though without explaining exactly why there is this
    reticence on the part of the poet.

[^182]: It is interesting to compare this non-description of Horace’s
    Sabine farm to *C*. 2.15 in which – according to Santirocco 1986,
    101 – the luxurious villa depicted is seen as “an assault upon
    nature” and as “an external threat to the natural landscape,” even
    “threaten\[ing\] the land’s fertility, leaving few acres to the
    plough.” See also Pearcy 1977, 775, suggesting that in *C*. 2.15
    “extravagant architecture serves to indicate resistance, public and
    private, to the natural order of things.”

[^183]: Miller 1991, 378, 383.

[^184]: See Paschalis 2002b, 73.

[^185]: Whereas Pasquali 1920, 659, notes an Epicurean influence in
    Horace’s depiction of the carefree *agrestes* (cf. Epic. fr. 570),
    Nisbet and Rudd 2004, 4, suggest that “Horace was also influenced by
    the end of the recently issued second *Georgic*, which in the same
    philosophical tradition had drawn a contrast between the happiness
    of farmers and the pomp of the rich” (cf. Verg. *G*. 2.461 ff.).

[^186]: Cf. *C*. 2.16.11-12. G. Williams 1969, 31, *ad loc*., points out
    that “however high he goes (in wealth or building), fear and
    forebodings…go as high.” Indeed, as Horace warns in an earlier poem,
    “lofty towers fall with a greater crash” (*celsae graviore casu* /
    *decidunt turres*, *C.* 2.10.10-11). Nisbet and Hubbard 1978, 163,
    *ad loc*., direct us to a passage from Lucretius as the “*figura
    etymologica*” for the idea here (cf. Lucr. 1.741: *et graviter magni
    magno cecidere ibi casu*).

[^187]: Nisbet and Rudd 2004, 21, *ad loc*., are to right to note that
    “\[a\]s *valle* suggests both lowness and seclusion it makes a
    contrast with *sublime.*”

[^188]: Leach 1988, 286-287. See also Whitehorne 1969, 32, arguing that
    “there is here little open reproof for the builder.” Armstrong 2009,
    90-91, would seem to take this idea too far in suggesting that
    Horace’s “poetic self-positioning as one who rejects high mansions
    is destabilized by his repeated descriptions of them within his
    verse… For all the rants against ambitious building projects,
    therefore, it is possible to detect at least a sideways
    acknowledgement of the attractions of such unnatural luxuries.”
    Indeed, according to Armstrong, “it is possible to read that most
    extreme example of man’s hubris, seaside engineering works, more
    positively, as the Augustan imposition of order on society writ
    large, extended to an imposition of order on the natural world.”
    While I agree with Armstrong that we need not read these structures
    wholly negatively, as I will discuss below, I do not find the extent
    to which the scholar takes this argument particularly compelling.

[^189]: For a comparison between these two poems, *C*. 2.18 and 3.1, see
    Whitehorne 1969, 32 and Pearcy 1977, 778-779.

[^190]: See above, pp. 5-6, for further discussion of what I mean by
    “architexture” and “architextural.”

[^191]: Faber 2005, 97. Faber’s “metaphorical” (or more accurately
    metapoetic) reading of these lines is based also “upon references to
    the poetry of Vergil and Pindar \[cf. *Ol*. 6.1-4\] in which the
    image functions figuratively, and upon diction which supports a
    higher level of meaning” (97). See also Armstrong 2009, 88-89, for
    whom “\[t\]he poem is a diatribe against the thoughtless
    accumulation of wealth and the reliance upon luxury to bring
    happiness, but it also hints at a poetic angle to the relationship
    between man and nature. The simple life, because closer to nature,
    is a happier one: Horace’s modest Sabine estate will always be
    preferable to a high-rise mansion; similarly, Horace’s verse, which
    expresses these moral values, aligns itself aesthetically with the
    most modest form of building, the *humilis casa*.”

[^192]: Faber 2005, 103.

[^193]: Lowrie 1997, 2. As Lowrie goes on to conclude, “\[a\] full
    understanding of Horace’s address to his own poetic inspiration must
    take account of the simultaneous assertion of a boundary, of its
    transgression, and of the accommodation of such transgression
    through a contemporary aesthetic.” See also Oliensis 1998, 102-157,
    for an excellent analysis of the concept of *fines* within the
    *Odes* and how it fits into a larger discussion of limits in the
    Augustan age. I will examine more the “imperial” character of
    Horace’s *Odes* in the final section of this chapter below, pp.
    79-89.

[^194]: See pp. 58-59, above, for a discussion of the analysis of this
    tension in Commager 1962.

[^195]: Lotman 1977, 299 (as cited in Fowler 1995b, 3); my emphasis.

[^196]: Lowrie 1997, 14, frames this problem in its temporal aspect in
    relation to *C*. 3.30 by stating that the *Odes* seem paradoxically
    to “belong to both the here and now, and eternity.”

[^197]: Collinge 1961, 69. In focusing on the end of the poem (14-16)
    and Horace’s prayer to his Muse for approval, G. Williams 1969, 152,
    claims that “\[t\]he attitude of prayer and thanksgiving is a
    perfect antidote to the expression of personal pride; the pleasure
    he feels in the pride of his humble home-town and the prayer of
    thanks to the Muse are two successive steps down from the assertion
    of his own achievement in 1-9.” Oliensis 1998, 104, considers
    Horace’s submission to the Muse at the poem’s end in a different and
    more affirming light: “Horace proudly submits himself here to the
    Muse, and to no other. Certainly not to Maecenas, nor even to
    Augustus.”

[^198]: See Fowler 1995a, 266, where he argues that while one should
    read with more than a hint of irony how Horace’s “great and glorious
    fame in *Odes* 3.30 will spread...all over Puglia and Basilicata,”
    the overall statement of the poem reveals a desire on the part of
    the poet that has been mostly hidden until this point.

[^199]: Santirocco 1986, 167-168. See also Putnam 1973, 10, where he
    claims that Horace here “proves himself an Augustus of the spirit
    whose feats are in parallel with, but incomparable to, those of his
    patron,” and Gibson 1997, 314, claiming that “Horace’s poem,
    confident and assured as it is, nevertheless suggests that the
    poet’s proper role is to seek immortality through poetry, rather
    than the more dangerous sphere of political achievement.” Fraenkel
    1957, 302-307, likewise considers Horace to be proud of his feat as
    a *princeps* of poetry (cf. 3.30.13); for Fraenkel, however, the
    poem illustrates that Horace was “convinced that \[his inspiration\]
    came from heaven” (307). Hutton 1972 makes the rather unconvincing
    biographical suggestion that the ambitious claims of *C*. 3.30
    “follow and represent Horace’s reaction on reading through his
    writings” (501).

[^200]: See Hardie 1993, 127, arguing that “*C.* 3.30 articulates the
    tension between the static immobility of the monument, or of the
    words viewed as signs marked on a sheet or tablet, and the dynamic
    and vital motion that inheres in Horace’s lyric poetry.”

[^201]: Fraenkel 1957, 302, claims – without any citations – that
    “\[t\]he magnificent opening period, down to 5 *et fuga temporum*,
    revives thoughts familiar from Greek poetry, especially choric
    lyric; in it there is nothing that might not have been said by a
    Greek poet.” There is an immense bibliography on the similarities
    and differences between Horace here and his predecessors, including
    Hutton 1972, 500 (Sappho, Leonidas of Tarentum); Putnam 1973, 2-5
    (Ennius, Lucretius, Pindar); Syndikus 1973, 275-276 (Pindar,
    Bacchylides); von Albrecht 1973, 62 (Ennius); Woodman 1974, 119-120
    (Pindar), 121-122 (Lucretius); Kennedy 1975 (Pindar); Hardie 1993,
    127-128 (Pindar, Ennius); Galinsky 1996, 352-353 (Ennius); Lowrie
    1997, 71-74 (Pindar); Nisbett and Rudd 2004, 365 (Aristophanes,
    Simonides, Callimachus); and Reitz 2013, 106-107 (Pindar).

[^202]: On this particular line see Borzsák 1964. Hardie 1993, 127,
    considers that *aere* can be read in two ways – \[1\] as “a bronze
    inscription,” since “\[t\]he language of the opening lines of *C.*
    3.30 is strongly reminiscent of the lapidary style of the monumental
    inscription,” or \[2\] as “refer\[ring\] to *statues* of bronze.”
    Hardie seems more intrigued by the second of these options,
    conjuring up Horace as “a Pygmalion who makes a statue of himself.”
    On the word *exigi* see also Putnam 1973, 2, and Galinsky 1996,
    351-352, asserting that “Horace’s choice of the word for ‘to build’
    has no counterpart in the surviving Roman inscriptions: instead,
    they use words like *aedificare*, *locare*, *facere*, and
    *absolvere. Exigere* also sounds the note of careful craftsmanship
    in the tradition of Hellenistic poetry.”

[^203]: See Putnam 1973, 2-3, pointing out that the word *perennius*
    serves as a “pun” (vis-à-vis the poet Ennius) which gives
    “particular importance” to the “aloofness from temporality.”
    According to the scholar, in fact, the “splendid unconcern with the
    horizontal line of time’s passage would...gain particular importance
    to an Augustan reader, aware of his Latin poetic heritage, from the
    word *perennius.*”

[^204]: On the image of the pyramids here see Fuchs 1962,
    Trencsényi-Waldapfel 1964, and Gibson 1997. Nisbett and Rudd 2004,
    366, *ad loc*., maintain that “Horace’s comparison with the pyramids
    has no recorded parallel in Greek poetry.”

[^205]: Woodman 1974, 121, claims that “\[a\]lmost imperceptibly Horace
    has changed ground to become identified with his own poetry. The
    change is intentional.” See also Putnam 1973 and Lowrie 1997 for
    similar interpretation of the identification of the poet and his
    monument.

[^206]: Putnam 1973, 6. See also Tarrant 1995, 33, making the pithy but
    apt statement that “the poet covers ground while adopting a
    structure that presents the illusion of standing still,” and Fowler
    2000, 198, putting a more deconstructive spin on the dynamic nature
    of Horace’s *monumentum* by asking us to consider that “\[t\]his is
    metaphorical marble, not real marble. But if real monuments decay,
    can we be so sure of metaphorical ones? Beneath the surface polish
    lurks the beginnings of decay, the potential for letters and sense
    to fall off the stone, the inner instability which in Horatian
    diagnostics always waits to betray the smooth marble front.” This
    reading is one that I find more applicable to Vergil’s *Aeneid*, as
    Chapters IV-V demonstrate below.

[^207]: Lowrie 1997, 11.

[^208]: As opposed, for instance, to the much less material monument
    that Ovid constructs at the end of his *Metamorphoses* (15.871-879),
    examined at length below, pp. 169-179.

[^209]: For the quality of monuments to be inherently dual in this
    respect see the discussion of Roman monumentality above, pp. 29-36,
    esp. 34-36.

[^210]: See von Albrecht 1973, 67, where he likewise interprets *C*.
    3.30 as a balancing of tensions when he writes that “\[o\]uter world
    and inner life, space and time, the typical and individual,
    political and private life are artfully balanced against each other.
    The Augustan Horace combines freedom and constraint” (*Außenwelt und
    Innerlichkeit, Raum und Zeit, Typisches und Individuelles,
    Politisches und Privates sind kunstvoll gegeneinander ausgewogen.
    Der Augusteer Horaz vereinigt Freiheit und Gebundenheit*). The idea
    of a co-existence of opposites in Horace’s poetry can also be found
    in Schiesaro 2009 with his ingenious notion of “Bacchic poetics” in
    which the god of wine in the *Odes* “stands as the guarantor of a
    freedom which is both thematic and stylistic because he can make
    opposites co-exist: pain and pleasure, *tenuitas* and *grandia,* the
    labours of *meditari* with the emotions of sudden inspiration, the
    paradox that prescribes the poet to be at one and the same time both
    himself and someone else in the struggle to combine originality and
    tradition” (72).

[^211]: The capacity of the *Odes* to be both traditional and novel also
    has been seen to occur at the linguistic level. According to
    Collinge 1961, 13, “\[t\]he first feature” of Horace’s language in
    the *Odes* that suggests itself to a reader is “the curious parallel
    existence of bold and tame, old and new.”

[^212]: Horace’s political stance towards Augustus and Augustan ideology
    has been the topic of a good deal of scholarship in the 20<sup>th</sup>
    Century – much of which is non-Anglophone, particularly (and not
    surprisingly) in the aftermath of WWII – including Mancuso 1953,
    Pöschl 1956, La Penna 1963, and Doblhofer 1966. See also Santirocco
    1995 (with bibliography) for a concise survey of the topic.

[^213]: Many scholars have remarked upon the inherently innovative
    quality of Horatian lyric, including: Putnam 1986, 24-25, where he
    suggests that “what we learn as we follow out such a narrative of
    lyrics is a cumulative matter. It is a process of discovery which
    never reaches an end. It forces us, once we have finished any such
    gathering of poems, to begin over again, with earlier questions
    answered and beauties elucidated, but with new issues, needing
    explanations, being raised, and new areas of connotation ever
    opening out”; Miller 1991, 388, arguing that “the lyric
    consciousness of the poet exists as a series of potential poetic
    sequences which together reflect and refract a finite series of
    historical, political and personal issues in an infinite variety of
    ways”; Edmunds 1992, 46, suggesting further that “the careful
    arrangement of the poems in books 1-3 presupposes reading and
    rereading”; and Lowrie 1997, 4, with the idea that Horace achieves
    eternal freshness because his “\[l\]yric keeps fragmenting any
    monolithic narrative sense.”

[^214]: Oliensis 1998, 107. See also Putnam 1990, 218, where he claims
    that “Horace is one of the great poets of liminality.” In a similar
    fashion Lowrie 1997, 36, calls Horace “a poet who delights in
    excursuses *ultra terminum* (‘beyond the limit’).”

[^215]: Cf. *C*. 3.6.1-4. For discussion of these lines see pp. 40-41
    above.

[^216]: Hölscher 2006, 241, suggests that there is a “presentness” in
    Augustan culture that “seems difficult to reconcile with a
    fundamentally retrospective orientation toward an all-dominating
    past.” As he argues, however, “\[t\]he artistic forms served the
    specific statement – and this statement was not at all
    retrospective, but contemporary and actual.” It is not that the
    Romans are obsessed with the past, for Hölscher, but that they use
    the forms of that past as “universal cultural instrument\[s\]” to
    produce a “vivid expression of contemporary concepts” (258, 244).
    From a non-classicist perspective Hirsch 1995, 23, claims that the
    “tension between tradition and the modern” can be “momentarily
    resolved in a representation that encapsulates the political fiction
    of a unified nation.” I would argue that the unresolved tensions of
    the Augustan age can be just as effective in a creating a powerful
    political fiction.

[^217]: Cf. *RGDA* 6: ...*senatu populoq*\]*u*\[*e Romano
    consentientibus*\] *ut cu*\[*rator legum et morum summa potestate
    solus crearer, nullum magistratum contra morem maiorum delatum
    recepi* (“...although the senate and people of Rome were in
    agreement that I alone should be made guardian of laws and conduct
    with the highest power, I received no magistracy offered against the
    custom of my ancestors”). Galinsky 1996, 258, also notes this as a
    possible source of “inspiration” for the kind of *recusatio* found
    in Horace’s *Odes*.

[^223]: See Elsner 1996, 39, suggesting that the most impressive
    Augustan monuments “do not need to be mentioned, because for a Roman
    citizen who wished to read the *Res Gestae*, they were inseparable
    from the experience of standing in front of the inscription.”

[^224]: Suet. *Div*. *Aug*. 28.3: *Augustus urbem adeo excoluit, ut iure
    sit gloriatus marmoream se relinquere, quam latericiam accepisse*.

[^226]: Cf. Verg. *Aen*. 8.347-348: *hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolia
    ducit* / *aurea nunc, olim siluestribus horrida dumis* (“\[Evander\]
    leads \[Aeneas\] from here to the Tarpeian seat and the Capitoline,
    / now golden, formerly bristling with forest-thorns”).

[^227]: See Cooley 2009, 201, *ad loc*., pointing out that “\[t\]he
    giving of gold by subjects to their rulers was a long-established
    practice associated with eastern kingship. \[…\] The giving of
    crown-gold was an expression of submission and homage on the part of
    the donor. It became usual for such ‘gifts’ to be turned into crowns
    of gold.”

[^229]: One of the most important points of this catalogue of buildings
    – despite the dedications to other people – is to show, as Ramage
    1987, 36, rightly claims, that “no one is given credit for doing any
    building or rebuilding in Rome and Italy except Augustus.”

[^230]: See Fraenkel 1957, 287-288, where he introduces the idea (echoed
    by several later scholars) that Horace was still cautious in 23 BCE
    of a relapse into civil war, as well as Putnam 1990, 238: “My
    reading of the Horace of *Odes* 1-3 sees \[Horace\] suggesting the
    very fragility of what would be assumed as Augustus’ ideals and the
    contingency of their realization on a series of delicate factors.”

[^231]: See Santirocco 1995, 229, suggesting that “ideology does not
    necessarily pre-exist the creative act, nor is it promulgated from
    on high, but that it is an interactive production involving poet,
    patron, and *princeps*.” Oliensis 1998, 149, is right to acknowledge
    that just “\[h\]ow wholehearted a supporter \[he\] is \[is\] a
    question Horace himself might not have been able to answer.
    Thoroughly implicated as he was in the Augustan regime, there was
    nowhere outside it for him to sit and think.” I do agree with Fowler
    1995a, however, in starting from the premise that “Horatian politics
    is bound up with Horatian poetics” (252), even if we may never
    separate the two.

[^232]: Galinsky 1996, 257. Lowrie 1997, 13, puts it well in claiming
    that “\[t\]he Augustan age creates Horace as much as Horace creates
    the Augustan age, but neither is univocal.”
