Two bronze columns were placed in front of Augustus’ Mausoleum at Rome
after the death of the *princeps* in 14 CE. These columns were inscribed
with a text describing the “*Res Gestae* of the Divine Augustus”
(*RGDA*).[^30] The prose of the inscription was relatively “simple” and
full of officialese phrases that some scholars would suggest provide
very little insight into how Augustus actually viewed his
achievements.[^31] Others see the text as “a complex and allusive
document, addressed to many audiences and with many levels of
meaning.”[^32] No matter what way one decides to read the *Res Gestae*,
though, it still represents perhaps the most definitive statement that
exists of how Augustus framed his work at Rome for posterity.[^33] It is
truly a monument both of and to the Augustan age.

This dissertation argues that the *Res Gestae* is also a text whose
monumentality needs be understood within the context of other literary
monuments of the Augustan age.[^34] The *RGDA* demonstrates how Augustus
used architecture – as much in his language as in the landscape of the
city – to redefine the way his subjects would see their restored *res
publica* on a continuum from Rome’s humble beginnings to its “collapse”
at the end of the republic and finally to its monumental transformation
under Augustus.[^35] But this monumentalization of Rome in the Roman
imagination was by no means the project of the *princeps* alone. Horace,
Vergil, and Ovid each added “monuments” of their own which would
anticipate the different ways in the *Res Gestae* that Augustus himself
would articulate his reconstruction of Rome – both as a city and as an
idea. Subsequent chapters will look in particular at how these three
poets of the Augustan age both critiqued and contributed to a
metaphorical transformation of Rome from crumbling brick to monumental
marble in the Roman imagination as much as in its physical reality.[^36]

To examine this shared project of the *princeps* and the Augustan poets
it will first be necessary to understand how each of them negotiated his
position from within the Roman tradition of viewing their world
architecturally. The current chapter will outline some aspects of this
tradition by briefly analyzing a few of the ways that architecture
helped to determine how the Romans structured their reality
conceptually.[^37] I will begin in Part 1 by analyzing the fundamental
link between architecture and order (political and otherwise) in
Vitruvius’ *De architectura*. Part 2 will then look at architecture’s
essential role in the Roman “art of memory” (*ars memoriae*). In Part 3
the ideas of the preceding two sections will be applied to exploring the
concept of Roman monumentality, with particular attention to how
“monuments” (*monumenta*) provided an opportunity for Romans both to
remember their past and critically examine how it fit within their
present. This survey will end by then turning in Parts 4 and 5 to how
two Romans – the historian Livy and Augustus himself – used a common
language of monumental architecture at the beginning of their respective
texts to represent the work they did to help “rebuild” Rome after the
supposed “collapse” of both the *res publica* and the *mores* upon which
it was founded.[^38]

This survey is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of the
role of architecture in the Roman imagination. Several of the topics and
texts touched upon here have been the subjects of much more thorough
studies. My purpose in this chapter is rather to build upon the work of
other scholars in order to provide a framework through which we might
contextualize how Augustan age poets fashioned their poetic *monumenta*
as contributions to the monumentalization of Rome. The point will be to
establish the historical and literary milieu in which to examine why
these poets fashioned their works as “monuments” in the first place, as
well as to consider how we might understand Augustus’ collective work in
Rome as an architectural *monumentum* in its own right.

Later chapters will demonstrate how Augustus used architecture in his
*Res Gestae* to redefine the traditional boundaries between past and
present, between private and public, as well as those between Rome as a
republic and Rome as his empire. He fashioned the city itself as a kind
of “memory store,” I argue, one which all of its citizens could
experience and use to define what it meant to be Roman in the Augustan
age. The *princeps* did not just add new monuments to the city, in other
words, but rather made Rome itself a monument, as he took what was a
city of brick and left it one of marble.[^39] The poets of this period
used the idea of the monument, too, as a means of expanding, dissolving,
and reconstituting the boundaries of their own poetry. This was not just
in response to what Augustus was doing; the poets were actively in
dialogue with Augustus’ monumentalization of the city, rather, and in
such a way that their readers could then also better appreciate and
evaluate what was happening to their Rome.[^40] It is one of the main
contentions of this dissertation, in fact, that we can better account
for Augustus’ successful monumentalization of Rome by examining in
parallel the “architexture” that several contemporary poets built in
fashioning their works of literature as “monuments,” too.[^41] And the
purpose of this chapter is to show why it was monumental discourse in
particular that served as the language through which Augustus and the
poets of his age imagined their works.

###Part 1. Architecturally Speaking: The Imagery of Vitruvius’ *De Architectura*###

Perhaps the most suitable place to start exploring the role that
architecture played in how Romans structured the world around them
conceptually would be with the only architectural treatise that survives
intact from antiquity, namely, Vitruvius’ *De architectura*. The
language that this late 1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE architect employed provides a
useful window into the intersection of architectural and political
discourse in the Roman imagination. It would seem that for Vitruvius the
state could in a sense not exist without its architecture – whether in
physical fact, or in even the language one uses to describe it.[^42] It
is through this discourse of monumental architecture that the architect
made sense of what Augustus had done to the *res publica*’s physical and
metaphorical foundations. And it should not be surprising, then, to find
that Vitruvius’ language anticipates to a certain degree the *princeps*’
own account of this transformation in the *Res Gestae* that will be
examined at the end of this chapter, as well as throughout the rest of
this dissertation.

There is no passage in the treatise that better illustrates the
architectural nature of this transformation than the preface addressed
to Augustus himself. Vitruvius was quite aware of what the *princeps*
had been doing to the physical appearance of Rome by the mid-20s BCE; in
fact, that is why the architect claims to have written his treatise in
the first place:

> cum uero adtenderem te non solum de uita communi omnium curam
> publicaeque rei **constitutione** habere, sed etiam de opportunitate
> publicorum aedificiorum ut civitas per te non solum prouinciis **esset
> aucta**, uerum etiam ut maiestas imperii publicorum aedificiorum
> egregias haberet auctoritates, non putaui praetermittendum quin primo
> quoque tempore de his rebus ea tibi ederem… (Vitr. Pr.2)[^43]
>
> When indeed I noticed the concern you had not only for the common life
> of all and the **structure** of the state but also concerning the
> opportunity for public buildings, so that the state would not simply
> **be made greater** by the acquisition of provinces, but that the
> majesty of the empire might also have the illustrious authority of
> public buildings, I thought I should not let pass the right
> opportunity to publish the following on these topics for you…”

In the same preface Vitruvius adds that he has dedicated his treatise to
Augustus because of what the *princeps* had done, was doing, and would
do to the architectural landscape of Rome. “I began to write this for
you,” the architect tells Augustus,

> quod animaduerti multa te aedificauisse et nunc aedificare, reliquo
> quoque tempore et publicorum et priuatorum aedificiorum, **pro
> amplitudine** rerum gestarum ut posteris **memoriae** traderentur
> curam habiturum… (Vitr. Pr.3)
>
> since I noticed that you had built and continue to build much, and
> that you would in your remaining time take care of both public and
> private buildings so that **memorials** would be passed down to
> posterity **proportional to the size** of your achievements…

These two passages demonstrate the importance that Vitruvius believes
Augustus attributed to architecture in Rome. In the first one, the
architect relates that the *princeps* erected buildings which had
“illustrious authority” (*egregias…auctoritates*) in order to ennoble
the state – even on the same level as the acquisition of new
territories. In the second, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that both
public and private buildings could serve as memorials (*memoriae*) to
the greatness of Augustus himself in the sense that they would reflect
the magnitude (*amplitudo*) of his military and political achievements.
As Kristina Milnor suggests, Vitruvius’ point here is “not simply that
\[Augustus\] has built more, better, and bigger…but rather that he has
revealed the ways in which architecture can mean something more than the
construction of buildings.”[^44]

That is not the point of my analysis, however. What interests me in
these passages is how the architectural *language* in them configures
(and reconfigures) the relationship between architecture and the
metaphorical structure of the Roman state. In the first passage,
Vitruvius neatly parallels the “structure of the state” (*publicae rei
constitutio*) with its public architecture (*publica aedificia*) through
a *non solum…sed etiam* construction. Through the *ut*-clause expressing
effort, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that the reason Augustus has been
taking such good care of Rome’s metaphorical and physical *constitutio*
is that the *princeps* himself is aware that the grandeur of the *res
publica*’s physical appearance can affect and indeed amplify the majesty
of its metaphorical greatness.

The use of architectural metaphors for the state in republican Roman
literature is not new, of course, as we will see below. What is striking
here is how by the end of the second passage it would seem that those
same sorts of architectural metaphors – and, in particular, the one
regarding “size” – have come to represent something other than “the
structure” of the republican state. In the first passage, it is the
majesty of the state that can be metaphorically increased in size by
Augustus’ deeds at home and abroad. In the second, however, the actual
buildings of Augustus’ reign, both private and public, suddenly become
*memoriae* for a new kind of metaphorical “structure” to be handed down
to posterity. The sense of greatness that these new buildings evoke
through their magnificent appearance is now proportional to the great
“size” of Augustus’ own “accomplishments” (*pro amplitudine rerum
gestarum*) – and no longer the greatness of state, as it was in the
earlier passage.[^45]

The architectural language that Vitruvius employs thus allows the
architect to stress the stability and structure that the *princeps* has
restored to the Roman world – something architectural metaphors do quite
well in general[^46] – while at the same time suggesting that a
transformation has occurred between the old “structure” of the state and
the new one under Augustus. In short, the *princeps* might be taking
care of the “structure” of the *res publica*; by the end of the preface,
however, that *constitutio* has been transformed from the old republican
one to one of Augustus’ own construction that signifies *his* greatness,
and no longer just the state’s.

Vitruvius was an architect, of course, and he was writing about
architecture. It should be noted, though, that seeing the state as a
building was not uncommon in the context in which Vitruvius was
building, writing, and thinking. At the very origins of Latin
literature, for example, there is a fragment from the epic *Annales* of
Ennius – famous already in antiquity, as quoted by Cicero at the start
of Book V of the *De re publica* – which proclaims that “the Roman state
is founded upon (*stat*) its *mores* and men of old.”[^47] Rome the city
and Rome the institution went together to such an extent that the
permanence and stability of its material buildings could even represent
the structure and stability of the state itself, as Cicero is so eager
to suggest of his own house in his *De domo sua*.[^48] According to
Alexander Demandt, in fact, “the stability of the masonry, the symmetry
of the overall system, the subordination of all individual forms to the
overall plan make the traits of the Roman political system
architecturally visible.”[^49] That is not to say that Vitruvius should
necessarily be taken as wholly representative of how all Romans
*consciously* thought about the structure of their state (if such a
thing is even possible to determine). What I would like to suggest is
rather that we understand the architect’s work as a more explicit
articulation of a deep connection that underlies the way that Romans saw
the world around them – a connection not just between the physical and
metaphorical idea of the Roman state, but more broadly between the idea
of architecture and structure itself.

A sequence of passages from the beginning of Book 2 of the *De
architectura* will help to flesh out this connection further. According
to Vitruvius, at least, the relationship between the architectural and
political spheres starts at the very beginnings of civilization. It was
the discovery of fire, Vitruvius tells us, which led to the near
simultaneous invention of architecture, political associations, and even
language:

> In eo hominum congressu cum profundebantur alitae e spiritu voces,
> cotidiana consuetudine **uocabula** ut optigerant **constituerunt**,
> deinde significando res saepius in usu ex eventu fari fortuito
> coeperunt, et ita sermones inter se procreauerunt. \[...\] Ergo cum
> propter ignis inuentionem conuentus initio apud homines et concilium
> et conuictus esset natus...coeperunt in eo coetu alii de fronde facere
> tecta, alii speluncas fodere sub montibus, nonnulli hirundinum nidos
> et aedificationes earum imitantes de luto et uirgulis facere loca quae
> subirent. (Vitr. 2.1.1-2)
>
> In this gathering of people when voices were being poured forth
> supported by breath, **they established words**, as it so happened,
> from daily habit. They began then by chance in this way to speak more
> and more, signifying different objects from habit, and thus invented
> speech among themselves. \[...\] Therefore when from the invention of
> fire the first meeting, assembly, and political association among
> humankind was born...from this gathering some began to make houses of
> leaves, others to hollow out caves under mountains, and some in the
> imitation of nests and constructions of swallows began to fashion from
> mud and twigs places where they could dwell.

This passage is famous for how Vitruvius tells of the origins of
architecture in such a way that it “becomes embedded with the memory of
primary human symbols, especially of fire and of the hearth, and of
shelter.”[^50] As before, however, the focus of this current study is on
the architect’s language. And it is notable that just as humans start
building physical structures, they are also said to be “building”
language (cf. *uocabula...constituerunt*) – and with it the very
foundations of society.[^51] It makes sense, then, that Vitruvius’
language itself suggests a correlation between political associations
and their architecture: without architecture, there would be no language
and no civilization.[^52] “In other matters, and especially in
architecture,” Vitruvius claims, “there are these two components: that
which is signified and that which signifies.”[^53] In Roman
architecture, for Vitruvius, it is not just the state that is signified
by architectural structures, but the idea of order itself – whether
physical, political, or perhaps even linguistic.[^54]

Only a few paragraphs later in Book 2 of the *De architectura* the
reader comes to a passage that confirms more concretely the deep
connection between architecture and the Roman state in particular:

> apud ceteras quoque gentes et nonnulla loca pari simulique ratione
> casarum perficiuntur **constitutiones**. Non minus etiam Massiliae
> animaduertere possumus sine tegulis subacta cum paleis terra tecta.
> Athenis Areopagi antiquitatis exemplar ad hoc tempus luto tectum. Item
> in Capitolio commonefacere potest et significare **mores** uetustatis
> Romuli casa et in arce sacrorum stramentis tecta. (Vitr. 2.1.5)
>
> Among other peoples and in certain places, as well, the **structures**
> of houses are fashioned in a like and similar way. No less can we pass
> over the roofs at Marseilles which are made without tiles but with
> earth joined with straw. The Areopagus at Athens – still an example of
> antiquity – is roofed with clay. In the same way Romulus’ hut covered
> with straw on the Capitoline is able to call to mind and signify the
> ***mores*** of antiquity. The same can be said of the roofs of the
> temples on the citadel.

In the immediately preceding sentences Vitruvius is merely discussing
how peoples in different places build their houses with the materials
available to them. However, as the architect continues to list the
varieties of materials necessary for the various kinds of
*constitutiones*, his language starts to slip between describing the
physical structures that remain and the *mores* (“behavior/customs”) of
the people who built them. This transition starts perhaps with a mention
of the Areopagus in Athens, which still exists as “an example of
antiquity,” but becomes more pronounced in the discussion of Romulus’
hut. “The image here is of a primitive hut,” of course, but as Idris
McEwan rightly suggests in her reading of the passage, “primitive
construction methods are not its signified matter.” It is such a basic
assumption for Vitruvius that the *constitutiones* of old buildings
represent the early “foundations” of the state – the *mores* upon which
it stands, as Ennius and Cicero put it – that he easily transitions from
talking about roof-making in Marseilles to the famous Areopagus of
Athens to Romulus’ hut in Rome together with the *mores* that it
represents.[^55]

This all appears to be very natural for Vitruvius, though. In his mind,
at least, architecture and political structures (together with the
language to describe them both) have been closely bound from the very
start of human civilization. And it is by practicing architecture, he
goes on to claim in the very next paragraph, that humankind not only
discovered “other arts and disciplines,” but also advanced “from a wild
and savage life to civilized society.”[^56] It is by *doing*
architecture, in other words, that people began to understand and
conceptualize other “structures” – scientific as well as political.[^57]
It is not hard in that case to see why architecture and architectural
language are such important parts of how Vitruvius articulates what he
sees happening to the landscape of Rome under Augustus both physically
and metaphorically. In short, the idea of “structure” – be it political
or otherwise – is by its very nature architectural for Vitruvius.[^58]

If we return to Vitruvius’s preface it is perhaps possible to see more
clearly now why he is so prone to employ architectural imagery to
communicate the changes that Augustus made to the *res publica* through
his public and private buildings. Since systems are inherently
architectural for Vitruvius, it makes sense that the architect uses
architectural imagery to convey the change in Rome’s system of
government – that is, its structure, or in Latin, its *consitutio*.

Did all Romans consciously see such a deep connection between
architecture and the imaginative systems by which they ordered their
existence? It is not possible to determine that with any certainty. And
we should be cautious about applying the *specifics* of Vitruvius’ views
as an architect to what other Romans, including Augustus, may have
consciously thought about architecture’s power as a metaphor for the way
they conceived the world around them. There is fortunately other
evidence, however, that suggests how architecture may have been an
essential component in the way that Romans gave order and meaning to
their lives and thoughts. The famous “art of memory” (*ars memoriae*)
that Roman orators employed required its users, as the next section will
demonstrate, to create architectural settings in their minds for the
purpose of structuring their own thoughts, as well as the thoughts of
their audiences.

###Part 2. The Architecture of the Roman *Ars Memoriae*###

In Book 2 of the *De oratore* Cicero writes about how the Greek poet
Simonides invented the so-called “art of memory.”[^59] And the
particular origin story that Cicero describes is relevant to this
current study for the role that architecture plays in it. The poet is
said to have been dining with one of his patrons, Scopas, when he was
called outside to meet with a pair of youths. As soon as he left,
though, the room (*conclave*) in which they were dining collapsed upon
Scopas and his companions. But when the friends of the dead wished to
bury their comrades it was Simonides who was able to help identify each
of the corpses because he knew the place in which each of them had sat
by remembering the setting itself.[^60] It was because of this, Cicero
writes, that the poet “is reported to have discovered that it is order
most of all that gives clarity to memory” (*invenisse fertur ordinem
esse maxime, qui memoriae lumen adferret*, Cic. *De or.* 2.353).
Simonides thus came to the conclusion that one could create places in
the mind to set the ideas one wanted to remember. In this way, then,

> ut ordinem rerum locorum ordo conservaret, res autem ipsas rerum
> effigies notaret atque ut locis pro cera, simulacris pro litteris
> uteremur. (Cic. *De or*. 2.354)
>
> while the order of places would keep the order of things, the symbol
> of the things would denote the things themselves, and we would use the
> places as we would wax tablets, and the symbols as we would letters.

Given that the first place to be involved in the art of memory was a
room in a house (*conclave*), it seems logical that it is mostly
architectural locales which are recommended as the places in which to
set symbols of what one wishes to remember. In the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
Latin rhetorical treatise known as the *Rhetorica ad Herennium*, for
instance, it is to architectural forms that the orator should turn as
the most suitable places for grounding his memory:

> Locos appellamus eos qui breviter, perfecte, insignite aut natura aut
> manu sunt absoluti, ut eos facile naturali memoria conprehendere et
> amplecti queamus: ut **aedes, intercolumnium, angulum, fornicem, et
> alia quae his similia sunt**. (\[Cic.\] *Rhet*. *Her*. 3.16.29)
>
> We call “settings” those places which are either naturally or
> artificially set off on a small scale, as a complete unit, and
> conspicuously, so that we can grasp and embrace them easily by our
> natural memory, such as **a house, the space between two columns, a
> corner, an arch, and other settings like these.**

Although the writer of the treatise suggests that the best places to set
symbols can be either “naturally or artificially set off” as distinct
(*aut natura aut manu…absoluti*), his list of locales includes *only*
architectural ones.[^61] Natural spaces can of course be small in scale
(*breviter*) and quite conspicuous (*insignite*) – both of which are
good qualities for constructing memory stores. It is architecture,
though, that best provides the sense of completeness (cf. *perfecte*)
which can give order and stability to a system of memory in which to
place symbols.[^62] Architectural settings give clear, distinct
boundaries, in other words, which promote a sense of order that a fully
natural setting on its own would seem less able to create.

Nor does it matter in the end how conspicuous and memorable a symbol on
it own might be. As the author of the *Rhetorica ad Herennium* stresses,
it is absolutely essential for orators to keep the architectural
backgrounds themselves fresh in their minds:

> Sed **illud facere oportebit**, ut identidem primos quosque **locos**
> imaginum renovandarum causa celeriter animo pervagemus. (\[Cic.\]
> *Rhet*. *Her*. 3.22.37)
>
> But **it will be essential to do this**: that we again and again run
> quickly in our minds through all the original **places** for the sake
> of remembering the symbols.

Orators should think of symbols that are distinctive enough to keep
separate in their minds; even more important, though, they must be able
to refresh the backgrounds for these symbols, or else it would seem that
the symbols have little value for memory on their own.[^63] If you lose
the place, in other words, you risk losing all the symbols that go with
it, too.

As scholars have argued, however, these “memory mansions” can affect not
just the minds of the orators, but potentially the minds of their
audiences, as well. In her influential book on Cicero’s use of space Ann
Vasaly has shown the way in which the *ars memoriae* also impacted how
the listeners of an oration would see the world around them. Since the
“training in the *ars memoriae* not only accustomed the orator to create
‘visual’ pictures in his mind but taught him to associate abstract ideas
with these pictures,”[^64] Vasaly suggests that

> Cicero may well have understood that the mnemonic technique by which
> he impressed ideas on his own mind could be employed to impress
> concepts on the minds of his listeners. \[…\] Cicero’s connection of
> ideas with specific places and objects… might…have figured in his
> application (whether conscious or unconscious) of the principles of
> the *ars memoriae* to the task of manipulating the thoughts and
> feelings of an audience.”[^65]

It is in part this specific understanding of the *ars memoriae* that
leads Vasaly to conclude her study with the pithy (and oft-cited) remark
that Cicero’s “constant reliance on the visual and the concrete was but
the Roman gateway to the world of ideas.”[^66] Although only the Roman
orator would see the memory mansion, of course, the construction of that
structure might have demonstrated to him the usefulness of using “the
concrete” (as Vasaly puts it) in order to impact the minds of his
listeners, too. “This method of memory training reminds us,” as Bettina
Bergmann claims, “how essential the built frame was for the Romans as an
organizer of objects, thoughts, and experience.”[^67] It is therefore
architecture, just as it was for Vitruvius above, which can be said to
have provided a sense of order for the Romans – even for a world created
within their imaginations.

Now that the fundamental connections between architecture and structure
in the constructions of the Roman state and of Roman memory have been
outlined it is possible to discuss a particular kind of architectural
space that links these two “structures” even more closely. These special
spaces which will be examined throughout the rest of this dissertation
produced a powerful and persuasive reminder of the past in the present
by serving as both setting and symbol at the same time. They thus acted
as an essential means by which Romans could establish an identity for
themselves that transcended time and (re-)defined their past as part
their present. These incredible and fascinating structures are what the
Romans called *monumenta* (“monuments”).

###Part 3. Roman *Monumenta* and Monumentality###

There is a clear divide in rhetorical theory between the architectural
settings and the symbols one places within them. As noted in the
previous section, Cicero writes that “while the order of places would
keep the order of things, the symbol of the things would denote the
things themselves.”[^68] In the preface to Vitruvius’ treatise, however,
Augustus’ architectural structures *themselves* seem to become the
symbols for representing his power: they are to serve as the “memorials”
(*memoriae*) to be handed down to posterity in proportion to the
“height” (*amplitudo*) of the *princeps*’ achievements.[^69] Such
buildings have a different effect on one’s memory than simply being the
background in which symbolic objects are placed; rather, they are in a
sense the symbols, too – just as both the Areopagus in Athens and
Romulus’ hut on the Capitoline can come to symbolize ancient *mores* in
Vitruvius’ eyes.[^70]

Architectural structures of this sort thus occupy a unique space as both
the symbol and the setting, representing what must be remembered and the
space that can give a solid form to that symbol in the imagination. The
Romans had a particular word for such a structure: *monumentum*.[^71]
For the Romans, at least, a *monumentum* provided not just a “reminder”
of some event or person in the past; more than that, it presented a
tangible, ordered, and often very conspicuous space in which to ground
and sometimes redefine that memory.[^72]

The next part of this chapter will demonstrate that the label of
*monumentum* need not be applied to a literal building – let alone a
physical object – in the text of Livy’ *Ab urbe condita*. That does not
mean, however, that an architectural significance is ever completely
absent from the term. In his *De latina lingua*, for instance, the
1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE antiquarian Varro provides an etymology which stresses
an evolution of the word along architectural lines.

> Meminisse a memoria, cum in id quod remansit in mente rursus movetur;
> quae a manendo ut manimoria potest esse dicta. \[…\] Ab eodem monere,
> quod is qui monet, proinde sit ac memoria; sic monimenta quae in
> **sepulcris**, et ideo secundum viam, quo praetereuntis admoneant et
> se fuisse et illos esse mortalis. Ab eo **cetera quae scripta ac facta
> memoriae causa** monimenta dicta. (Varro *Ling.* 6.49)[^73]
>
> *Meminisse* (“to remember”) comes from *memoria* (“memory”), since
> there is again movement back toward that which has remained in the
> mind – and it is possible that this word was derived from *manere*
> (“to remain”) like *manimoria.* \[...\] From the same word comes
> *monere* (“remind”), because he who reminds is exactly like a memory;
> so are derived *monimenta* (“monuments”) which are in **gravesites**,
> and for that reason they are along the road so that they can remind
> passersby that they themselves lived and that the passersby are
> mortal. From this definition **other things that are written or
> produced for the sake of memory** are called *monimenta*.

Although the word *monumenta* was originally attached to “gravesites”
(*sepulchra*) along the road, Varro claims that the word eventually came
to refer to anything “written or produced for the sake of memory” (cf.
*cetera quae scripta ac facta memoriae causa*).[^74] This particular
version of the word’s history does suggest, however, that Romans at the
end of the republic still understood the architectural significance of
*monumentum*; in fact, as John Bodel puts it, “\[t\]he term
*monumentum*…was in classical Latin *vox propria* for ‘tomb’, and the
primary purpose of a tomb.”[^75]

A *monumentum* is thus on the one hand an object that reminds us of
something else – something that is absent, that is abstract, that is
separate from us.[^76] Roman monumentality creates a kind of “aura,” as
Walter Benjamin would say, that produces “a sense of distance, however
close \[an object\] may be” (*apparition unique d’un lointain, si proche
soit-il*).[^77] And yet architectural *monumenta* are present, right in
front of us, visible as well as tangible. It is just as important to
acknowledge this sense of presence together with that of absence because
of the effects that the former can have upon a viewer. For example, as
Jaś Elsner claims in his study on the discourse of monumentality in
Greco-Roman historiography,

> monuments as ideas or ideological constructs always have the added

The “present-ness” of a monument makes it an effective form of
persuasion. Architectural structures of stone or some other long-lasting
material impose a sense of solidity and permanence upon the mind of an
onlooker that helps turn such artifacts into “proof” that an event in
the past happened.[^79] There is a reason, as discussed above in the
preceding section, why Roman orators relied upon such structures not
only for enhancing their own memories but even for changing the
perspectives of their audiences. What could be a more persuasive form of
evidence than an imposing structure that seems to resist the corrupting
agents of time or the limits of gravity placed upon all things?

Roman monumentality when understood in this light is not merely about
the size or shape of a structure.[^80] Nor about the time and wealth
that it took to construct it.[^81] Nor even necessarily related to the
monumental nature of the “subject” itself that is being
commemorated.[^82] All those aspects – together with the sense of
durability discussed above – do contribute to monumentality. As I define
it, however, monumentality is the ability of a structure in particular
to suggest something significant about the past to a viewer, that is, to
urge an onlooker to stop and reflect upon the structure’s meaning.[^83]
I am not suggesting that all “documents” of the past should necessarily
be seen as monuments, as Michel Foucault claimed that they are today by
historians.[^84] It is rather the sense of having an architectural
*structure* – as with the original conception of the Roman *monumentum*
as a tomb noted above – which sets monuments apart from other objects of
the past in this dissertation. That structure does not always have to be
literal, of course, as we will see in the case of the poetry examined in
the following chapters. What all these texts do have in common is the
way they use the idea of structure inherent to Roman monumentality to
configure the generic boundaries of their poetry – whether by stressing
it (Chapter III), destabilizing it (Chapter IV-V), or even transcending
it (Chapter VI).

The location, the size, the material, the decoration, the labor, even
the age[^85] – all these attributes, either in total or individually,
open up a dialogue with the viewer.[^86] Why is a monument where is?
What does its form or decoration or inscription signify? Who built it
and why? And ultimately what does it mean to me and who I am? Those are
just a few of the questions that a monumental structure raises in the
imagination of whoever its audience may be. There might not be one
meaning, of course, but the point is that a structure with monumentality
can stimulate people who come across it to respond by thinking about its
significance to them and by extension their place in the world.

It is this quality of monumentality to cause reflection that makes
monuments so important for the way that many cultures give definition to
their own identity. For the Romans, too, as Wallace-Hadrill suggests,
“monumental building require\[d\] such a concerted attempt on the part
of a community, \[was\] such a commitment of resource, and le\[ft\]
behind so conspicuous a public symbol, that it is hard not to read it as
a significant statement of identity.”[^87] Part 1 of this chaptr
suggested that such an understanding of monumentality underlies several
of the passages from Vitruvius’ treatise: a *monumentum* such as the hut
of Romulus can serve, for instance, as a mirror by which Romans could
understand the humble *mores* of Rome’s past – just as the grand
monuments of the architect’s present could help Romans come to terms
with the current greatness of their empire, as well as that of their new
*princeps*.

There is another side to monumentality, however, that is just as
important to consider when looking at the idea of the monument in the
Roman imagination. In the moment that a *monumentum* causes its onlooker
to think about its meaning there is also the opportunity for him or her
in this instant of reflection to consider the nature of monuments
themselves. There is an opening, in other words, to think about how a
monument works – as well as how it might fail. In an illuminating essay
on monuments in Roman poetry Don Fowler tried to articulate this complex
duality which is inherent to monumentality:

> The epistemological status of the monument is an uncertain one…
> Reading the stones is always multiple, but it cannot be so controlled:
> and it will do no good to argue that those who read the monuments
> differently must have been misreading them. \[…\] The essence of the
> monument is paradoxically its lack of monumental stability, the way in
> which it is constantly reused and given new meaning, and therefore its
> inability to offer a return rather than a new journey.[^88]

Monuments do not last forever.[^89] Yet their physical appearance is not
the lone aspect of these structures that begins to fade away with time:
their meaning is subject to change even more rapidly perhaps with each
new viewer. Although modern scholarship tends to describe this
epistemological “failure” of the monument as part of its so-called
“death” in the 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries,[^90]
this dissertation suggests that the Romans of the Augustan age productively
acknowledged and even embraced the inherent malleability of meaning
within their idea of monumentality.[^91] The chapters following this one
will examine how the Augustan poets engaged with the monumentalization
of Rome by staging it in the monumentalization of their own poems –
taking advantage of the dual nature of monuments to open the process up
to critique while contributing to it at the same time. In the concluding
chapter I will return to the issues surrounding monumentality in our own
present to suggest that the Romans responded to a monument’s dual nature
as both stable and instable epistemologically not by proclaiming its
“death,” as many have today, but rather by utilizing that very same
(seemingly paradoxical) stable flexibility to breathe new life into
traditional structures, generic and political as much as architectural.

Before I begin to analyze Augustan poetry, however, it will be
beneficial to have a better sense of the sort of monumental discourse
with which the poets were engaging. And for that I will now turn to a
prose author and text whose monumentality has been the focus of much
scholarship: Livy and his history of Rome *Ab urbe condita* (“From the
Founding of the City”).[^92] My focus here will be on Livy’s famous
preface. Not only will the analysis of Livy’s text provide a taste for
what is to follow in the examination of Augustan poets; it will also
illustrate in action several of the ideas regarding monumentality in the
Roman imagination discussed thus far.

###Part 4. Livy’s Monumental History###

The Roman historian Livy started at the very beginning of the Augustan
age to write his history on the city of Rome from its earliest days to
his present. The preface to this immense work presents a connection
between architecture and the state that is very similar in certain
respects to the one that was analyzed above in the imagery of Vitruvius’
treatise. There is a difference, though, and a rather important one:
whereas the architect writes about the building up of Rome, the
historian is focused just as much on Rome’s supposed “collapse.” Livy
was writing at a time when Rome was in ruin – both the physical city and
the idea of the state – and the future seemed far from certain.[^93]
What matters most for the present study is that Livy seems to put forth
his own work as a possible solution to the breakdown of Rome’s
“structure.” He fashions his history as a *monumentum* in itself – one
that can anchor and materialize the past while at the same time
utilizing the less stable side of monumentality to fashion better
readers of Rome’s monumentalization under Augustus.

Several passages in Livy’s preface aim to establish his history as
another *monumentum* within the city of Rome. The historian quite
explicitly uses the example of a monument, in fact, in explaining to his
readers how they should understand his work:

> Hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum,
> omnis te exempli **documenta** in inlustri posita **monumento**
> **intueri**; inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capias, inde
> foedum inceptu foedum exitu quod uites. (Liv. Pr.10)[^94]
>
> There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful part in the study
> of \[past\] affairs, namely, that you **examine proofs** of every
> possible example as set on a distinguished ***monumentum***. You may
> then choose for yourself and your state what to imitate, as well as
> what you should avoid as bad in their beginning as they are in their
> outcome.

In this way, as scholars have argued, Livy’s history itself also becomes
a kind of *monumentum*.[^95] The language he uses here transforms his
readers into viewers who can examine (*intueri*) the examples
(*exempla*) that Livy puts forth in his text – choosing to emulate the
good and avoid the bad. This is not the first time in the preface that
Livy uses the word *monumentum*, either. A few sentences earlier he
mentions that he is not going to affirm or deny the tales of Rome’s
early history which he claims are “more fitting for poetic stories than
for the incorruptible *monumenta* of accomplishments” (*poeticis magis
decora fabulis quam incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis*, Pr. 6). It
is clear here, too, that Livy sees his work as on par with *monumenta*.
It is important to note, moreover, that for Livy these “monuments” take
on the quality of being able to display an established truth as opposed
to poems which are filled with mere “stories” (*fabulae*). It would
seem, in other words, that the historian fashions his history as a
*monumentum* at least in part because of the ability that monuments have
to serve as more fitting sources of “proof” than mere words themselves.
As discussed in the previous section, architectural *monumenta* do at
least appear to have a certain stability – physical and therefore
epistemological – which can lend credence to the events of the past that
they commemorate. And it is precisely because of their status as
(seemingly) stable evidence that Livy claims they can present actual
*exempla* from the past to imitate or avoid.

Livy’s use of architectural imagery is much more nuanced, however, and
it will be necessary to examine the architectural nature of a few other
passages from the preface to grasp more accurately what he sees as the
purpose of his work.[^96] Just a couple of sentences earlier, for
instance, Livy talks of his work in the context of other writers who
have done or will do more than he has – and thus cast him and his work
into obscurity:

> …si in tanta scriptorum turba mea fama **in obscuro** sit, nobilitate
> ac **magnitudine** eorum me qui nomini officient meo consoler. (Liv.
> Pr.3)
>
> …if in such a great crowd of writers my own reputation should be
> thrown **into the shade**, I would console myself with the renown and
> **greatness** of those who obscure my fame.

Here the architectural metaphor applies to more than just Livy’s work:
other historians have in a sense “erected” histories whose great size
will throw his history into their shade. They not only have a certain
nobility (*nobilitas*) because of their undertakings, but their works
also have a certain magnitude (*magnitudo*). Given the way that Livy
carefully configures his work as a *monumentum* it seems likely here
that he means something more than huge volumes that exceed his in
physical size. Each history is seen by Livy as a “monument” in its own
right – perhaps just like the ones that had begun to fill Rome as the
*princeps* started to assert his power and transform the architectural
landscape of the city in the early 20s BCE.

There is even more to examine here, though. Livy’s metaphorical use of
*magnitudo* in this passage is not far from the way examined earlier
that Vitruvius employed *amplitudo* in relation to the transformation of
the Roman state under Augustus.[^97] And Livy not surprisingly justifies
his own work – which is by no means small – by juxtaposing it to the
“size” of the Roman state, too:

> Res est praeterea et immensi operis, ut quae supra septingentesimum
> annum repetatur et quae ab exiguis profecta initiis eo creuerit ut iam
> **magnitudine** laboret sua. (Liv. Pr.4)
>
> The subject, moreover, is also one of an immense labor, as one which
> we must investigate starting from over 700 years ago and which, having
> originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
> now toils under its own **great size**.

Even if the Roman historian’s *monumentum* is not the largest, it is by
no means small, either. Livy’s topic necessitates a certain “size,” as
he immediately goes on to say, because the subject – that is, the
history of Rome – requires an immense amount of work (cf. *res est
praeterea et immensi operis*). Livy’s monument must be large enough, in
other words, to cover the whole history of Rome – a place which, having
“originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
toils under its own great size” (*ab exiguis profecta initiis eo
creverit ut iam magnitudine laboret sua*).

The architectural imagery in the preface thus extends to more than
simply Livy’s own history, or even those of his peers; it also extends
to the greatness of Rome itself. Livy is thus clearly participating in
the same tradition of looking at the Roman state architecturally that
was examined above in the works of Ennius, Cicero, and, most notably,
Vitruvius.[^98] It is important to note, however, that unlike Vitruvius
the historian here speaks of a state – and the *mores* upon which it was
founded – not increasing in magnificence but instead in terms that
suggests its gradual “collapse,”[^99] as the following passage
demonstrates:

> **labente** deinde paulatim **disciplina** uelut **dissidentes**[^100]
> primo mores sequatur animo, deinde ut magis magisque **lapsi sint**,
> tum **ire** coeperint **praecipites**… (Liv. Pr.9)
>
> Then as gradually morality **declines**, let \[the reader\] follow how
> our *mores* at first **fractured**, then **collapsed** more and more,
> and finally began **to plunge into headlong ruin**…

The very same *mores* that were the foundations upon which we saw Ennius
and Cicero claim the Roman state stood (*moribus antiquis res stat
romana virisque*) have gradually weakened over the course of Rome’s
history until the point that they have now “collapsed” (*lapsi*) – and
sent the state into ruin with them (*ire*…*praecipites*).[^101]

In the above analysis of Vitruvius’ treatise it was argued that to view
the state architecturally also meant that its physical architecture
would become symbolic for the idea of the *res publica* itself. This is
significant for the present discussion of Livy because the physical
setting of Rome had deteriorated much in the 1st century BCE, at least
from the perspective of texts of the period which connect this apparent
physical deterioration to that of state’s metaphorical structure and
*mores*. For example, Horace emphatically begins one of his famous
“Roman *Odes*” with a lament for “the collapsing (*labentis*) temples of
the gods” – together with an exhortation to Romans to “restore”
(*reficere*) them if they are ever to atone for the sins of their
fathers committed during the civil wars:

> Delicta maiorum inmeritus lues,
> Romane, donec **templa refeceris**
> **aedisque abentis** deorum et
> foeda nigro simulacra fumo. (Hor. *C*. 3.6.1-4)
>
> Though you do not deserve it, Roman, you will continue to atone for
> your fathers’ sins, until you have **restored the temples and the
> collapsing shrines** of all the gods and their images defiled with
> black smoke.

For the poet the physical renewal of Rome is absolutely essential to its
metaphorical reconstruction: the Romans cannot make up for the damage
they did to the state in the past until they rebuild the temples that
represented their former virtues. The *monumenta* in Rome had begun to
crack, in other words, and so had its people’s belief in the virtue that
these structures were supposed to represent.[^102] For Rome to
re-establish itself and breathe life back into the values it had relied
upon during its rise to power not only did someone have to improve the
physical landscape of the city – or restore (*reficere*) it, as Horace
writes – but that person also had to re-establish the belief in that
landscape’s ability to reflect what it meant to be Roman as it had done
in the past.[^103]

If that is the case, though, an interesting question arises: how should
one read Livy’s *monumentum* in the context of such “ruin”? What purpose
does it have when it would seem that the “structures” of Rome’s past
have themselves collapsed? It has been suggested that Livy’s
*monumentum* represents a small part of a rehabilitation process – not
just as another monument to Rome, but also as a means of revitalizing
the Roman people’s belief in the structures that these monuments were
meant to symbolize.[^104] As Mary Jaeger has shown in her monograph on
the topic, however, the process by which Livy accomplishes this task is
not a simple one. Jaeger argues that the historian’s focus on monuments
both provides lessons about the past and at the same time should make a
reader suspicious of those same lessons. Since Livy must rely on
imperfect monuments of the past to construct his history, his work
simultaneously cannot but “remind the reader that a coherent account of
real past events is not a reproduction but a reconstruction.”[^105]
Jaeger looks particularly at *monumenta* in the text that “fail to point
unambiguously back to a particular person or event” in order to show how
Livy provides an alternative perspective to Augustus’ “Golden Age”
Rome.[^106] This is not so much to critique the *princeps*’
monumentalization of the city as to “construct a reader” who could play
in active role in interpreting monuments and thus make “national memory
personal.” The historian accomplished this task, according to Jaeger, by
making sure that his readers would “receiv\[e\] Livy’s interpretation of
the past, not just as images in the mind’s eye, but as a heightened and
altered awareness of the space around him or her.”[^107]

It was not Livy’s responsibility alone to “construct” readers who could
critically read Augustus’ monumentalization of Rome and understand their
place in it. Subsequent chapters of this dissertation will show how the
historian was indeed not the only writer in the Augustan age to critique
the project of monumentalization to which he was also contributing
through his monumental work. The critical assessment of Rome’s
transformation that I argue can be found in several poets of the
Augustan age may have been just as important part of its eventual
success as the historian’s contribution.

Before I turn to how these poets contributed to this project, though, it
is time to return to where this chapter began, namely, with Augustus and
his *Res Gestae*. Although I will come back to the *princeps*’ version
of his transformation of Rome in much more detail at the end of each
subsequent chapter (with the exception of Chapter IV), the present
analysis of Augustus’ language here in the final section of this chapter
will help to demonstrate how the *princeps* dealt with the
reconstruction of the state’s appearance not just in reality, but in the
Roman imagination, as well, from the very start of his account.

###Part 5. A Monument to the Monumentalization of Rome###

In the opening chapter of his *Res Gestae* Augustus speaks of the two
charges that he received when he first came into real power:

> **res publica** **n\[e quid detrimenti caperet,\]** me pro praetore
> simul cum consulibus pro\[videre iussit. p\]opulus autem eodem anno me
> consulem, cum \[consul uterqu\]e in bel\[lo ceci\]desset, et
> **triumvirum rei publicae constituend\[ae** creavit\]. (*RGDA* 1.3-4)
>
> The state ordered me as a propraetor to take care together with the
> consuls **that it not be diminished in any way**. In the same year,
> moreover, the people elected me as consul, when both consuls had died
> in war, and as triumvir ***rei publicae constituendae***.

As a *propraetor* the young Octavian was assigned by the state itself to
take care “lest it be diminished in any way” (*ne quid detrimenti
caperet*). In the same year, moreover, the people elected him as consul
and triumvir *rei publicae constituendae*. The wording of these two
charges is not entirely unexpected or remarkable. The first was the
“usual formula” for addressing emergencies in the late republic when a
*senatus consultum ultimum* (SCU) was issued.[^108] And *rei publicae
constituendae* is a stock phrase of sorts – one that might have
originated with Sulla,[^109] one which was used often by Cicero in his
works,[^110] and one that can be found on several denarii minted by the
individuals of second triumvirate themselves.[^111]

These two tasks are thus not altogether novel – and Augustus certainly
did not invent the language for them. But they do reflect something
important about the Roman state suggested at length in this chapter,
that is, the connection between architecture and the idea of the Roman
state in the language that Romans used to discuss their *res publica*.
There is the sense here, in other words, of there being a “structure” of
the *res publica* in the words that Augustus uses to talk about his
charges. For one, the word *detrimentum*, whose primary definition is
“material reduction” or “diminishment,”[^112] is derived from *detero* –
a verb that is specifically related to the wearing down of physical
objects, such as streets (in Lucretius) or tablets (in
Propertius).[^113] Moreover, although most translations of *rei publicae
constituendae* read something like “for settling the state,” or “for
setting the state to rights” (as one scholar translates it in a recent
book which addresses the topic),[^114] the verb *constituo* and its noun
*constitutio*[^115] are commonly used to refer both to the “founding” of
a city and its laws,[^116] as well as to the “construction” of a
building such as a house, as seen above in the passages from
Vitruvius.[^117] Even at this early point in the *Res Gestae*, then, a
reader would come across a subtle balancing act that the *princeps*
performs again and again throughout the document: while Augustus was in
charge of making sure that the “collapse” which Livy writes about did
not continue, he simultaneously had to construct the Roman state anew.
In other words, whereas Augustus needed to build a new Rome out of the
ruin (*rei publicae constituendae*), he also needed to avoid damaging
the traditional structure itself in any obvious way.

Are these empty metaphors typical of an Augustan inscription? That
possibility cannot entirely be ruled out, of course. What I would like
to propose, however, is that the wording here and elsewhere in the *Res
Gestae* suggests something essential about how Augustus articulated for
posterity his (re-)construction of Rome upon its traditional
foundations. It does not seem unreasonable, for instance, to connect the
architectural discourse in the *RGDA* to the complex idea of the
monument that underlies Augustus’ famous quote to have left Rome a city
of marble examined in Chapter I.[^118] It is in fact the goal of each of
the following the chapters to flesh out the nuances of this connection
by juxtaposing later sections of the *Res Gestae* with close analysis of
the *monumenta* that poets of the Augustan age built through their
poems.

It is certainly correct to say that “Augustus used the physical
topography of the city to his advantage: through the reorganization of
the urban environment of Rome, he effectively communicated that a change
had taken place.”[^119] And the way that the Augustan poets treated that
topography in their poetry allowed Romans more fully to appreciate and
better interpret the specific monuments of their physical reality. The
point of this dissertation is to show how Horace, Vergil, and Ovid also
helped their readers to navigate the architectural *discourse* that
Augustus would use in his *Res Gestae* to articulate this
monumentalization of their city. These three poets each provides a
mirror, I will argue, by which we can understand how Augustus used
architectural discourse to redefine, without appearing to knock down,
the traditional boundaries that had “structured” the Roman state up to
his time. By analyzing how they expand, test, and dissolve the generic
boundaries of their poems *qua* “monuments” we can come to recognize the
effectiveness of the *Res Gestae* to celebrate the monumentalization of
Rome in reality as well as the idea of it in the Roman imagination. The
rest of this dissertation will propose, in short, that the Augustan
poets helped to fashion readers who could better understand what had
happened to their Rome, real and imagined, through the lens of
architectural discourse that their poetry helped to sharpen.

[^30]: As it is stated in the heading to copies of the *RGDA* itself
    found outside of Rome: “A copy has been placed below of the *res
    gestae* of the divine Augustus, by which he subjected the world to
    the rule of the Roman people, and of the expenses which he incurred
    for the state and the Roman people, having been inscribed on two
    bronze pillars, which were placed at Rome” (*Rerum gestarum divi
    Augusti, quibus orbem terra\[rum\] imperio populi Roma\[n\]i
    subiecit, et impensarum quas in rem publicam populumque Romanum
    fecit, incisarum in duabus aheneis pilis, quae su\[n\]t Romae
    positae, exemplar sub\[i\]ectum*; cf. Suet. *Div. Aug*. 101.4:
    *indicem rerum a se gestarum, quem vellet incidi in aeneis tabulis,
    quae ante Mausoleum statuerentur*). I will be using the Latin text
    of the *RGDA* from Cooley 2009 here and in following chapters of
    this dissertation. All translation are my own, unless otherwise
    stated.

[^31]: Although Gordon 1968, 132, maintains that the *Res Gestae* is
    “simple in structure, flat, without style...not in the least
    reflective or philosophical in tone,” he nevertheless does provide a
    useful summary of what other critics have thought about the style of
    the *Res Gestae* – most of whom praise the inscription’s “clarity,”
    “brevity,” “simplicity,” and “cool dignity” (137-138, n. 61). Rowe
    2014 makes the intriguing suggestion that we should understand the
    *RGDA* as a compilation of various honorary decrees from the senate
    to Augustus that he (or someone else) put together just before his
    death in 14 CE; according to Rowe, in fact, the text is as much a
    “commemoration of commemorations” from the senate to Augustus as any
    personal statement by the *princeps* himself.

[^32]: Bosworth 1999, 1. See also Ridley 2003, 51-66, for a discussion
    of several “parallel texts,” including the famous four-verse epitaph
    for Scipio Hispallus and the inscription detailing the life and
    works of L. Munatius Plancus.

[^33]: See p. 2, n. 6, above for bibliography on the *Res Gestae*.

[^34]: See Elsner 1996, 48, claiming that “\[m\]onumentality, the
    conceptual and rhetorical space a monument occupies in the
    environment of its observers, is of the essence to the *Res
    Gestae*’s programme.” Recent scholarship has paid particular
    attention to monumentality in the ancient world – from Häusle 1980,
    29-63, which examines the language of Roman monuments, to Elsner
    1994, analyzing the language describing monuments, to Fowler 2000,
    193-219, which looks critically at both these sets of discourse.
    Wiseman 1987, Bodel 1997, Eck 1997, and Roller 2010 all treat the
    monumentality of the physical aristocratic houses and villas in the
    late republic and early principate. Thomas and Meyers 2012
    represents perhaps the most recent attempt to define Roman
    monumentality, with particular emphasis on Etruscan and early Roman
    architecture. See Part 3 of the current chapter (pp. 29-36) for a
    fuller discussion of Roman monumentality, including the definition
    that is employed in this dissertation.

[^35]: Elsner 1996, 40: “In effect, by surveying the city
    topographically and by cataloguing a carefully selected group of
    monuments constructed or restored by Augustus, the *Res Gestae*
    framed the viewing of Augustan Rome. For it told Romans how their
    city should now be seen.” As this dissertation will suggest,
    however, the *Res Gestae* has the same effect for the *metaphorical*
    structure of the Roman *res publica* in the Roman imagination

[^36]: My focus will be on the rhetoric that accompanied and supported
    the idea of the monument rather than on Augustan monuments
    themselves, as the latter has been topic of much scholarship in
    recent years. See Zanker 1988 for an approach to Augustan
    architecture that focuses on the architectural remains that have
    survived either physically or through the images from coins,
    painting, and literature. Ward-Perkins 1981 \[1994\], 21-45, and
    Favro 1998 present excellent overviews of Augustan architecture’s
    importance from this perspective, as well – the latter suggesting
    that “Augustus sparked a reconceptualization of the city’s physical
    form as a bearer of meaning” (216). But see also Galinsky 1996 and
    Wallace-Hadrill 2008 for analyses of Augustan culture that
    complicate the almost strictly top-down approach that both Zanker
    and Favro espouse.

[^37]: Elsner 2014, 19, employs Aristotle’s famous triad of *ethos*,
    *logos*, and *pathos* to suggest that “\[a\]rchitecture, as a
    three-dimensional discourse that formed the environment where people
    lived their lives, may be said to stress *logos*, as the social
    reality that mediated the doings of people within the Roman world.”
    That is not an unreasonable suggestion. In this chapter, though, I
    draw upon the way that the Romans themselves conceived of
    architecture in order to establish my own theoretical framework for
    analyzing the texts in subsequent chapters.

[^38]: Of course, as Gruen 1974, 1-2, wisely warns, “\[h\]indsight
    deceives and distorts. \[…\] In order to explain the Republic’s
    fall, it has seemed appropriate to ransack preceding generations for
    symptoms of decline and signposts for the future. The portrait is
    shaped to suit the result – a retrojected prophecy.” However, as
    Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 56, argue, “\[p\]olitically, a ruinous
    and decaying space was an important element of Augustan ideological
    fashioning, and...the notion that destruction and devastation are
    the foundations upon which the city flourishes is a vital
    element...of Augustus’ ‘cultural revolution.’” This dissertation is
    not concerned with the reality of a historical “collapse” of the
    republic, but rather examines that same “hindsight” which Gruen
    mentions – which clearly paints the narrative of Rome’s recent past
    as one of “collapse” – as found for instance in the works of Livy
    and Horace. For more discussion of this “collapse” see Part 4 below,
    pp. 36-43.

[^39]: See above, p. 11, for a brief discussion of Augustus’ famous
    boast (recorded in Suetonius) that “he was leaving behind a city of
    marble which he had received as one of brick” (*urbem…marmoream se
    relinquere, quam latericiam accepisse*, *Div. Aug*. 28.3).
    Hölkeskamp 2006, 481, defines “collective memory” in the Roman
    republic as that which “helps a group or society as a whole to
    articulate an awareness of its defining characteristics and its
    unity, and therefore forms an essential basis for its self-image and
    identity.” By turning Rome itself into a kind of *monumentum* – that
    is, by not simply adding monuments to its landscape, but
    transforming the landscape itself in the imagination of his subjects
    – Augustus could have a tremendous influence on the institutions and
    places through which the Roman people came to “articulate an
    awareness of its defining characteritics…its self-image and
    identity.”

[^40]: In examining the way that the poems of Vergil, Tibullus, and
    Propertius treat specific Augustan monuments, Rea 2007, 16, proposes
    that “the poets’ texts and the Augustan landscape, while raising
    awareness of both the potential advantages and problems that the
    community would encounter when trying to rebuild their society, also
    permitted viewers to realize their own conclusions about what they
    saw and took away from their interaction with the texts and the
    landscape.” Whereas Rea sees Augustus’ monuments as “inspiration”
    for the poets, it is important to consider their poems not merely as
    responses to the Augustan project of monumentalization, but as
    contributions to its definition, as well.

[^41]: I find inspiration for this approach in Saiber 2005, 10, where in
    the analysis of the architectural discourse in Giordano Bruno’s
    writing the scholar expresses the idea that “spatial
    conceptualization *is* intrinsic to human thought and that exploring
    the many ways in which space and form manifest in literary language
    – metaphorically, structurally, methodologically, hermeneutically –
    will help deepen our understanding of the world around and inside
    us, as well as the reason for literature.” See pp. 5-6 above for how
    I define “architexture” in this dissertation.

[^42]: See McEwan 2003 for an analysis of the Vitruvian/Augustan
    architectural project which suggests that the “body” (*corpus*) of
    the Roman empire only came into being through its architecture. Both
    Gros 1994 and Novara 1994 come to similar (yet more cautious)
    conclusions that anticipate McEwan’s argument.

[^43]: The Latin text of Vitruvius here and following is from Fleury
    1990 and Callebat and Gros 1999 for Books 1 and 2, respectively. See
    below, pp. 43-45, esp. n. 87, for a discussion of the nuances of the
    noun, *constitutio*, and its verb, *constituo*.

[^44]: Milnor 2005, 119.

[^45]: Nor even of the Roman people, as it is in Livy, for example, when
    he writes of the time when “the senate ordered that duumvirs be
    elected for making the temple \[of Juno Moneta\] **proportional to
    the greatness of the Roman people**” (*Senatus duumuiros ad eam
    aedem **pro amplitudine populi Romani** faciendam creari iussit*,
    Liv. 7.28).

[^46]: As Foucault 1980, 148, puts it in speaking of pre-Modern
    structures, “the art of building corresponded to the need to make
    power, divinity and might manifest. \[...\] Architecture manifested
    might, the Sovereign, God.” The same could be said of architectural
    imagery, as Victor Hugo is so keenly aware in his *Notre Dame de
    Paris* (1831) when discussing architecture and its ability to
    represent the “structure” of power.

[^47]: Cic. *Rep*. 5.1 in Ziegler 1969: *moribus antiquis res stat
    romana virisque* (cf. Enn. *Ann*. 500 V.<sup>2</sup>). For this metaphorical
    use of *stare* see *OLD*, s.v. “**4** (of things) To be in an
    upright position on or set in the ground or other support... **15**
    (of cities, building, etc.) To continue to stand (usu. implying the
    continuance of the institutions associated with them... **21** (of
    abst. things, w. abl. or *in* + abl.) To rest, depend, be based
    (on).” See Richardson 2005 (with bibliography) for how the Roman
    camp can also be seen to reflect this connection between
    metaphorical (or “celestial”) and physical order.

[^48]: Cf. Cic. *Dom*. 100-103. See Jaeger 1990, 32-39, and Edwards
    1993, 156, claiming that “this passage…suggest\[s\] the particular
    symbolic associations the destruction of a man’s house might have.”
    See also Treggiari 1999, 55-56, on *Dom*. 143-147 and the way that
    “Cicero links the gods of the City and those of his private house”;
    for Cicero, Treggiari argues, “the home was inextricably linked with
    religion, civilization, the city and state, the institution of
    marriage and the family” (40).

[^49]: Demandt 1982, 54: “*Die Stabilität des Mauerwerks, die Symmetrie
    der Gesamtanlage, die Unterordnung aller Einzelformen unter den
    Gesamtplan machen Wesenszüge der römischen Staatsordnung
    architektonisch sichtbar*.” See also Purcell 1989, 160, where in
    speaking of the *Forum Romanum* he claims that the space contains “a
    concrete rendering in the architectural space of institutional
    forms” – an “illustration,” according to Purcell, “of how the Romans
    reified their constitutional abstractions.”

[^50]: Frith 2004, 39-40: “With the story of origins of the Primitive
    hut is also woven the history of human speech and community arising
    from the gathering around the hearth. Through this narrative,
    architecture becomes embedded with the memory of primary human
    symbols, especially of fire and of the hearth, and of shelter... In
    this way Vitruvius aligns the origins of building with the origins
    of human society and of concord. Through the reconciliation of the
    Primitive dwelling with human speech, order is possible in society.”

[^51]: The connection between architecture and thought is certainly not
    unique to the Roman imagination. It is interesting to note – as Hahn
    2001, 100-101, does – that Egyptian goddess Seshat was the “goddess
    of architecture and reckoning,” as well as being “recognized as the
    inventor of writing and the Head of the House of Books.” Hugo 1831
    would appear in agreement with Vitruvius concerning the connection
    of human thought and architecture, as the nineteenth-century
    Frenchman would write that “\[a\]rchitecture...developed together
    with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a
    thousand arms, and fixed under an eternal, visible, palpable form
    all this floating symbolism” (*L*’*architecture...se développa avec
    la pensée humaine; elle devint géante à mille têtes et à mille bras,
    et fixa sous une forme éternelle, visible, palpable, tout ce
    symbolisme flottant*). See also Heidegger 1951 \[2000\], 163, where
    the German philosopher famously triangulates the relationship
    between thinking and building with the idea of “dwelling” – which he
    sees as “*the* *fundamental trait* of being, in accordance with how
    mortals exist” (*Das Wohnen...ist* der Grundzug *des Seins, demgemäß
    die Sterblichen sind*). On the relationship between architecture and
    writing see also Alain 1920, 105-123, Le Goff 1978, Hamon 1986,
    Hollier 1989, Wigley 1993, Karatani 1995, and Cowling 1998.

[^52]: Several scholars have noted the importance of the Roman
    conceptualization of architecture to rhetoric and the Roman
    conceptualization of rhetoric to architecture. Frith 2004, 41,
    claims that “\[i\]f the task of architecture is to represent order,
    its means are enabled by *eloquence*. \[...\] The significance of
    the reliance by Vitruvius on rhetoric cannot be overstated.
    Architecture takes on the character of oratory in Western
    traditions, such that buildings are expected to ‘say’ something.”
    See also F. R. Brown 1963, Bek 1976, Gros 1991, Callebat 1994, Caye
    2011, and now Elsner and Meyer 2014, 35-114, esp. E. Thomas 2014,
    each of which takes a slightly different approach to the
    intersection of the “architecture” of architecture and that of
    rhetoric (and *vice versa*). See also Woodman 1988, 81-95, for an
    overview of Cicero’s use of architectural metaphors for discussing
    the “foundations of historiography.”

[^53]: Vitr. 1.1.3: *Cum in omnibus enim rebus, tum maxime etiam in
    architectura haec duo insunt, quod significatur et quod
    significant*.

[^54]: According to the famous 17<sup>th</sup>-century French architect Claude
    Perrault in his edition of Vitruvius, “\[a\]rchitecture is of all
    the sciences the one to which the Greeks gave a name signifying
    superiority and stewardship over the others” (cited in Hollier 1989,
    36). See also Ruskin 1849, 205, claiming that “architecture must be
    the beginning of arts, and that the others must follow her in their
    time and order.” For how Vitruvius is in possible dialogue here with
    Stoic philosophy see also McEwan 2003, 57, arguing that “Vitruvius
    understood architecture in terms of a purposeful universe, a
    world-body shot through with same cohesive ratio that made, for
    Cato, the Stoic system which reflected it ‘so well constructed, so
    firmly jointed and welded into one.’ It is especially in its
    unquestioning assumption of the cardinal value of coherence that *De
    architectura* belongs to Stoicism.”

[^55]: McEwan 2003, 81, also connects this passage in the *De
    architectura* to the aforementioned line from Ennius (which Cicero
    quotes at the beginning of Book 5 of his *De re publica*): “For an
    educated Roman, the *mores vetustatis* signified by the hut of
    Rome’s founder would have been the same as the customs of ancient
    times that Cicero claimed were the foundation of the Roman
    commonwealth.” See also Rea 2007, 21-43, for an analysis of the hut
    of Romulus in Augustan poetry, with a particular focus on its
    relation to the *Domus Augusti*.

[^56]: Cf. Vitr. 2.1.6: *cum autem cotidie faciendo tritiores manus ad
    aedificandum perfecissent et sollertia ingenia exercendo per
    consuetudinem ad artes peruenissent… tunc uero ex fabricationibus
    aedificiorum gradatim progressi ad ceteras artes et disciplinas, e
    fera agrestique uita ad mansuetam perduxerunt humanitatem.* See also
    Callebat and Gros 1999, 75, noting *ad loc*. that “this theory of
    civilization – which dates without doubt to Xenocrates, but was
    developed to its full potential by the schools of Hippocrates and
    Democritus – may have been transmitted to Vitruvius through Cicero”
    (\[*c*\]*ette théorie de la civilization qui remonte sans doute à
    Xenocratès*, *mais dont les écoles d’Hippocrate et de Démocrite ont
    développé toutes les potentialités, a peut-être été transmise à
    Vitruve par l’intermédiaire de Cicéron*). But see Rowland, Howe, and
    Dewar 1999, 173, *ad loc*., suggesting that “Vitruivius probably got
    most of his account from Lucretius” and citing Lucr. 5.925-1105 as
    the most likely source.

[^57]: See Hollier 1989, 33, claiming that “\[t\]here is...no way to
    describe a system without resorting to the vocabulary of
    architecture. When structure defines the general form of legibility,
    nothing becomes legible unless it is submitted to the architectural
    grid. Architecture under these conditions is the archistructure, the
    system of systems. The keystone of systematicity in general, it
    organizes the concord of languages and guarantees universal
    legibility.” Wilson 1988, 61-62, 153, takes an anthropological
    approach to this topic and argues that “\[a\]rchitecture is a
    materialization of structure, and the adoption of architecture as a
    permanent feature of life introduces spatial organization and
    allocation as an ordering visual dimension. Some circumstantial
    evidence of the transfer of spatial structure to the structure of
    human activities is present from the beginning... Domesticated
    society is founded on and dominated by the elementary and original
    structure, the building, which serves not just as shelter but as
    diagram and, more generally, as *the source for metaphors of
    structure that make possible the social construction and
    reconstruction of reality*” (my emphasis).

[^58]: See Frith 2004, 40, analyzing this passage and similarly
    concluding that “\[s\]ociety can only have developed once the
    origins of building had been established, permitting human beings to
    develop the other arts and sciences, and so human beings ‘passed
    from a rude and barbarous mode of life to civilization and
    refinement.’” In speaking of the emergence of Western politics in
    the Greco-Roman world, McEwan 1993, 73-74, goes so far as to suggest
    that “if we understand the craftsman as a *demiourgos* in the wider
    Greek sense of the term, yet retain the primordiality of the notion
    of craft in its more limited, physical sense, as the early Greeks
    did when they claimed that there was no community, no civilization,
    without such craft, then it becomes quite clear that the emergence
    of Greek politics – indeed of Western politics – hinged upon the
    craft tradition, and upon how craft was understood”; in fact,
    according to McEwan, “all of Western thinking was first grounded in
    architecture” (130). See also Senseney 2011, 9, where he argues for
    a connection between architectural drawing and the birth of Western
    philosophy. One of Senseney’s primary contentions is that we should
    understand the “relationship between drawing, seeing, and the birth
    of theoretical philosophy as an inward seeing associated with
    knowledge (‘insight’), ways of envisioning nature, and even the
    nature of vision itself.”

[^59]: On the Greco-Roman *ars memoriae* see Rossi 1960, 1-14, Yates
    1966, 1-49, Blum 1969, and Leach 1988, 75-78. Vasaly 1993, 100-102,
    Treggiari 1999, and now Möller 2013, 283-294, all treat Cicero’s
    account of the art in particular. Bergmann 1994 successfully
    demonstrates how a Roman aristocrat could use the *ars memoriae* to
    structure the art displayed in his villa in such as a way as to
    emerge “as a cultured agent in the Roman creation of an ancestral
    past” in front of his guests (255). Non-classicist scholars have
    also paid attention to the Roman *ars memoriae*, including: Said
    2000, 179-180, arguing that “\[m\]emory for Cicero was something
    organized and structured. \[...\] The modern art of memory is much
    more subject to inventive reordering and redeploying than that”; and
    Wilson 1988, 76, where he suggests that “\[i\]n many ways the memory
    system of Cicero is a reversal of the ‘order’ of events in which
    architecture serves people. The memory system pins facts onto
    buildings, but in everyday life buildings present, represent, and
    commemorate facts of the world to people.”

[^60]: Cic. *De or*. 2.353: *Paulo post esse ferunt nuntiatum Simonidi,
    ut prodiret; iuvenis stare ad ianuam duo quosdam, qui eum magno
    opere evocarent; surrexisse illum, prodisse, vidisse neminem: hoc
    interim spatio **conclave** illud, ubi epularetur Scopas,
    concidisse; ea ruina ipsum cum cognatis oppressum suis interisse:
    quos cum humare vellent sui neque possent obtritos internoscere ullo
    modo, Simonides dicitur ex eo, quod meminisset quo eorum loco
    quisque cubuisset, demonstrator unius cuiusque sepeliendi fuisse…*

[^61]: Cf. Quint. 11.2.18-20, where the 1<sup>st</sup>-century CE Roman
    rhetorician suggests that a typical Roman villa is an excellent
    place for setting the symbols that one wants to remember. Leach
    1988, 75, argues that “\[a\]lthough the rhetorical writings of the
    Republic contain no specific guidelines for describing topographical
    contexts or landscapes, they do provide evidence, perhaps even more
    enlightening than prescriptive formulas might be, for a structure of
    thinking closely associated with the conceptualization of physical
    places and for the visual powers that such mental activity
    necessitates. These suggestions are incorporated into the
    fundamental discipline of the *ars memoriae.*”

[^62]: See Part 1 of this chapter above, pp. 16-25, for a discussion of
    the connection of order and architecture in the Roman imagination.
    This link between order and architecture can be found in many modern
    theorists, as well, including: Scott 1914 \[1999\], 174, where he
    claims that “our instinct craves for order, since order is the
    pattern of the human mind. And the pattern of the mind, no less than
    the body’s humour, may be reflected in the concrete world”; and
    Olsen 1986, 307, stating that “\[t\]he human mind has in all times
    and places attempted to impose an intelligible structure on
    disorderly reality” through architectural structures.

[^63]: As the 20<sup>th</sup>-century French philosopher Gaston Bachelard puts it
    in his important essays on *La poétique de l’espace*, “memories are
    motionless, all the more solidly those which are better fixed in
    space” (*souvenirs sont immobiles, d’autant plus solides qu’ils sont
    mieux spatialisés*, 1957 \[1961\], 37).

[^66]: Vasaly 1993, 257. See Jaeger 1997, 20-23, for how the *ars
    memoriae* was a model that Livy relied upon in his reconstruction of
    Rome – as well as in his “construction” of a readership that could
    read it (for which see below, pp. 42-43).

[^71]: Although the alternative spelling, *monimentum*, is less
    frequent, it will appear in several of the texts that I will cite
    hereafter. I will always use the *monumentum* spelling for
    discussing the concept in general.

[^72]: See also Jaeger 1997, 16, speaking of how *monumenta* “occupy a
    middle ground” in a more temporal sense from the one I am discussing
    here, namely, that “\[t\]hey remind people here and now of events
    and persons that are remote in space and time. They stand between –
    between their maker and their viewer; between an exploit, *res
    gesta,* and the viewer or reader whom the commemorated exploit
    inspires.”

[^73]: The Latin text of Varro is from Spengel and Spengel 1885.

[^74]: Cf. Festus p.123 L: *Monumentum est, quod et mortui causa
    aedificatum est et quicquid ob memoriam alicuius factum est, ut
    fana, porticus, scripta et carmina*; Porph., *ad* Hor. *C*. 1.2.15:
    *monumentum non sepulcrum tantum dicitur, sed omnia* *quidquid
    memoriam testator*; Flor. *Dig*. 11.7.42: *monumentum generaliter
    res est memoriae causa in posterum prodita*. For a concise catalog
    of the different uses of *monumentum* see Jaeger 1997, 17-18 (and,
    in particular, n. 9). Drawing upon *TLL* 8.1460-1466 Jaeger suggests
    that the term denotes virtually any sort of “reminder” – from
    “buildings to place-names; from items made for the purpose, like
    inscriptions and statues, to acquired marks, like scars and
    mutilations; from published versions of speeches to trophies and
    spoils.”

[^75]: Bodel 1997, 21. See also Hollier 1989, 36, claiming that “\[t\]he
    monument and the pyramid are where they are to cover up a place, to
    fill in a void: the one left by death. Death must not appear, it
    must not take place: let tombs cover it up and take its place.”

[^76]: As Häusle 1980, 59, frames it, “\[i\]t is the nature of every
    monument that it points beyond itself” (\[*e*\]*s liegt im Wesen
    jedes Denkmales, daß es über sich hinausweist*). See also Jaeger
    1997, 18, arguing that “to look on a *monumentum* is to experience a
    psychological distance between oneself and the *monumentum,* the
    consciousness of being separate from, contrasted with, or measured
    against it.”

[^77]: Benjamin 1936, 43. This discussion of “aura” comes from
    Benjamin’s famous essay (originally published in French) on idea of
    “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” For a
    discussion of Benjamin and his thoughts on architecture see Vidler
    2000, 81-97. Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 12-15, also turn to
    Benjamin’s conception of architectural space to introduce their
    recent volume on *The Sites of Rome: Time, Space, Memory*.

[^78]: Elsner 1994, 224-225. See also E. Thomas 2007 for a nuanced
    treatment of Roman monumentality in the Antonine era. According to
    Thomas, monuments were largely responsible for giving tangible form
    to the idea of the Roman empire in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Century CE.

[^79]: See Edwards 1996, 134, where the scholar notes that “\[t\]ying
    ideas and monuments to places may seem to anchor them, to give them
    permanence,” even if that anchoring itself is only temporary. There
    are other effects, of course, that a monument’s assumed stability
    and permanence can have upon its viewer according to modern
    scholarship on the topic. Choay 2001, 6-7, argues that “\[f\]or
    those who erect it, as for those who receive its messages, the
    monument is a defense against the traumas of existence, a security
    measure. It is the guarantor of origins, allaying anxieties inspired
    by the uncertainties of our beginnings. Antidote to entropy, to the
    dissolving action of time on all things natural and artificial, it
    seeks to appease our fear of death and annihilation.” To this end,
    moreover, a monument can even serve as a means of proclaiming one’s
    immortality to posterity, as Wilson 1988, 130, suggests:
    “\[Monuments\] aim to produce *the effect of permanence.* At the
    deepest metaphysical, spiritual level, tombs overcome death. If this
    is so, then the greater, more solid and monumental the tomb or
    mausoleum, the greater the effect of overcoming death, the more
    convincing and successful the effort would seem to be, the more
    probable it would appear to onlookers as well as perpetrators that
    death has been conquered.”

[^80]: Meyers 2012, 1-20, presents an excellent introduction to the idea
    of monumentality in the Roman and Etruscan world in a co-edited
    volume with Michael Thomas that is dedicated to the topic. Meyers
    points to three qualities of monumentality in specific: \[1\]
    “durability,” \[2\] “visibility,” and \[3\] “commemoration.” See
    also the contribution to the volume by P. Gregory Warden (82-110),
    in which he argues that “\[t\]he impression of monumentality can
    also result from the deep historicity of architectural forms” (97).
    E. Thomas 2007, 17-28 (“Principles of Monumental Form in Antiquity”)
    presents a wide-ranging yet concise survey of monumentality in the
    ancient world in general and 2<sup>nd</sup>-century CE Rome in specific.

[^81]: See Tuck 2012, 56: “\[M\]onumentality need not be understood
    simply in terms of amplification of architectural scale. The
    perception by the intended audience of monumentality, whether of
    structure or event, relates more to the degree of observable energy
    and expense invested in it.”

[^82]: Warden 2012, 97: “A work can be monumental in its style as well
    as in its materiality, and I would argue that a work might be
    monumental in its subject.”

[^83]: According to Miles 1995, 17, “*Monumentum*…is based on IE
    \**men*-, ‘to think,’ plus the causative suffix \*-*yo*, plus
    *mentum*, and expanded form of the suffix -*men*, and so means, at
    base, ‘something that makes one think.’” In his famous essay on
    “Architecture” (1910) Alfred Loos describes one’s experience of
    architectural structures along fairly similar lines: “When walking
    through a wood, you find a rise in the ground, six foot long and
    three foot wide, heaped up in a rough pyramid shape, then you turn
    serious, and something inside you says: someone lies buried here.
    *That is architecture*” (as cited in Hollier 1989, xxi).

[^84]: Foucault 1969, 15. I will discuss below, pp. 199-200, how
    Foucault’s views fit into the more general discourse of
    monumentality in modernity.

[^85]: See Riegl 1903, 22-29, for a discussion of *Alterswert*
    (“Age-Value”). In his influential 1903 essay on *Der Moderne
    Denkmalkultus: Sein Wesen und Seine Entstehung* (“The Modern Cult of
    the Monument: Its Form and Origin”), Riegl goes on to distinguish
    also \[1\] *historische Wert* (“Historical Value”) and \[2\]
    *gewolte Erinnerungswert* (“Intentional Commemorative-Value”), as
    well as in his own time \[3\] *Gebrauchswert* (“Use-Value”) and
    \[4\] *Kunstswert* (“Art-Value”), as the other ways in which one can
    appreciate the monumentality of an object.

[^86]: The 20<sup>th</sup>-century Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein would
    seem to have understood architecture – or at least “*gute
    Architektur*” – in a similar way, that is, as something that
    engenders a response in its viewer. “Architecture is a *gesture*,”
    Wittgenstein claims. “Not every purposeful movement of the human
    body is a gesture. No more is every functional building
    architecture. \[…\] Remember the impression of good architecture,
    that it expresses a thought. You want to respond to it with a
    gesture.” (*Architektur ist eine* Geste*. Nicht jede zweckmäßige
    Bewegung des menschlichen Korpers ist eine Geste. Sowenig, wie jedes
    zweckmäßige Gebaude Architektur* \[…\] *Erinnere Dich an den
    Eindruck guter Architektur, daß sie einen Gedanken ausdruckt. Man
    möchte auch ihr mit einer Geste folgen*, 1980, 42, 22.)

[^87]: Wallace-Hadrill 2008, 103. For how monuments can serve to define
    Greek and Roman “Others,” as well, see also Elsner 1994, 228-229,
    where he argues that a “monument, the product of a people, can serve
    to epitomise what is typical about them. It can freeze what is…the
    essence of a people in a convenient and accessible miniature. The
    monument becomes not only the product of, but also a metonym for the
    race, the culture, the way of living, the rationality and
    expectations of the people and environment. \[…\] They encapsulate
    identity by embodying the past as it exists in the present; they
    focus in terms of the past the present’s sense of being what it is.”
    On the connection between architecture and identity more broadly see
    also Norberg-Schulz 1971, 29, claiming that “\[d\]uring his \[or
    her\] development the individual discovers a structured whole which
    he \[or she\] shares with others and which more than anything else
    gives him \[or her\] a sense of identity,” and Sherratt 1990, 165,
    where the scholar concludes that “\[m\]egalith building became the
    metaphor within which social conflicts and ideological competition
    were played out. In this sense, megaliths were as much a cause as a
    consequence of social complexity.”

[^88]: Fowler 2000, 205, 209-210, 211.

[^89]: This was especially the case, perhaps, in Roman culture where
    *spolia*, that is, architectural pieces taken from one building or
    monument to construct another, demonstrated quite explicitly the
    physical malleability of monuments. See Kinney 2001 where he delves
    deeply into significance of *spolia* as not merely “symptoms of
    influence, but symbols of the acceptance of authority of the
    Latin/Roman past” (140).

[^90]: On the “death(s) of the monument” in modernity see Hugo 1831,
    Mumford 1937, Smithson 1966 \[1996\], Choay 2001, Carpo 2007. I will
    return to this topic in the conclusion to this dissertation below,
    pp. 189-202.

[^91]: Many scholars of monumentality today have discounted the Roman
    version of the concept as facile. See Choay 2001, 19, arguing in her
    landmark study on the idea of the monument in Western culture that
    the monuments of the Romans – while seemingly based on a modern
    conception of monumentality – were “not oriented toward a vision of
    the past” in the way that modern ones are; rather, according to
    Choay, these monumental structures were “motivated by taste and a
    desire \[on the part of the Romans\] to infuse themselves visually
    with the plastic world of Greece.” See also Riegl 1903, 10, claiming
    that “\[a\]ll of Antiquity and the Middle Ages in essence only knew
    intentional monuments” (*Das ganze Altertum und Mittelalter haben
    nun im Grunde bloß gewollte Denkmale gekannt*). In the same essay,
    though, Riegl would at least admit that the Romans presented “an
    anachronistic precursor of modern commemorative value” (*ein
    anachronistischer Vorläufer des modernen Erinnerungswertes*). As I
    demonstrate in this dissertation, however, the Roman understanding
    of *monumenta* was highly-developed and perhaps even more nuanced in
    certain respects than the way many look at monuments today.

[^92]: See Wheeldon, 1989, Moles 1993, Miles 1995, 16-20, Jaeger 1997,
    *passim*, esp. 1-29, and Feldherr 1998, 1-50.

[^93]: Livy wrote the first five books of his *Ab urbe condita* from 27
    to 25 BCE. For discussion (with bibliography) of the dating of the
    text see Feldherr 1998, 48, n. 149.

[^94]: The Latin text of Livy’s *Ab urbe condita* is from Ogilvie 1974.

[^95]: Moles 1993, 153: “\[t\]he *monumentum*…is *also* Livy’s *Ab urbe
    condita* itself.”

[^96]: Jaeger 1997, 23, argues that Livy is more concerned with “the
    active role that his audience must play to comprehend the past” in
    viewing a monument than its “size, solidity, and durability.” At the
    same time, however, it is important to see how Livy here does rely
    on metaphors of size and stability – or rather their lack – in
    discussing not only his *monumentum*, but the structure of the Roman
    state, as well.

[^97]: See pp. 17-18 above.

[^98]: See pp. 16-25 above.

[^99]: See Jaeger 1997, 6, where the scholar proposes that “\[t\]he
    reader of Livy’s preface…comprehends Rome’s entire past…in the
    architectural metaphor of the construction and collapse of a massive
    edifice.”

[^100]: There is an important textual issue in this passage with the
    word *dissidentes*, which has also been read as *desidentes*
    (“falling”). However, I agree with Ogilvie 1965, 27, arguing *ad
    loc*. that “the metaphor is not of a slipping body but of a house
    tottering, breaking up, and collapsing and *dissidentes*, describing
    the disunity and disintegration of the *mores*, seems an appropriate
    word.”

[^101]: Ogilvie 1965, 27, *ad loc*., cites a fragment from Sallust’s
    *Historiae* as a *comparandum*; in fact, according to Ogilvie, even
    though “the collocation recalls Ennius…the terms had long passed
    into the political vocabulary.”

[^102]: Zanker 1988, 16-17, detects a change in the physical monuments
    of the late republic, as well, in the way that “\[p\]ublic monuments
    ceased to express any of the old political values, such as rank and
    service to the state.”

[^103]: In writing of cultural memory in the Middle Republic, Hölkeskamp
    2006, 481, argues that “\[t\]he spectrum of forms, institutions, and
    places through which a cultural memory may find its articulation and
    permanence, the relative importance of these forms and, above all,
    the specific, synergetic connections of media and location that
    result in ‘systems’ or ‘landscapes’ of memory…are themselves
    integral components of \[a society’s\] cultural memory.” In the case
    of late republican Rome, however, there seems to have been the sense
    that this link between the “landscapes” of their city and the Roman
    “cultural memory” had been destabilized by the “collapse” of the
    structures themselves.

[^104]: See Moles 1993, 153-154, arguing that “\[i\]n so far as it is an
    abiding monument, its solidity will help shore up the collapsing
    edifice of the Roman state… In important senses, therefore, it may
    be said that for Livy AUC history is his own work, the *Ab urbe
    condita*, and that in reconstructing Roman history he is in a moral
    sense reconstructing contemporary Rome.” See also Wheeldon 1989, 59,
    who concludes that “\[h\]ere, in addition to the traditional claim
    for the value of *historiae* as sources of right conduct, Livy
    offers first, in the image of monumentality, a summation of the
    earlier claims for his work (on the basis of its size and the labor
    involved in writing it) and second, in the order in which the
    metaphors of the two passages appear, the more ambitious suggestion
    of the reconstruction – via the reading of his own work – of Roman
    greatness.” It is not just Rome that he is reconstructing, I would
    argue, so much as the power of Roman monumentality itself to give
    Romans a sense of themselves as Romans in a new age.

[^109]: Sulla’s “official” title according to the *Lex Valeria* was
    *dictator legibus scribendis et rei publicae constituendae*. (cf.
    Appian *BC* 99.1). On this title see Hurlet 1993, 95, Sordi 1993,
    and Vervaet 2004, 41, n. 18, stating that “it should not be
    questioned that \[Sulla\] was indeed appointed *dictator legibus
    scribendis et rei publicae constituendae* by virtue of the *lex
    Valeria*.” See also Kunkel and Wittmann 1995, 702-711, claiming
    that, on the contrary, Sulla “*war kein Diktator legibus
    scribundis*,” but only “*rei publicae constituendae*” (703). For
    further bibliography on Sulla’s title see Vervaet 2004, 41, n. 20.

[^110]: Cf. Cic. *Rep*. 1.11, 2.64, 3.7, and esp. 6.12, where Scipio
    Aemilianus is told in his famous dream that “as dictator \[he\]
    should structure the state, if \[he\] will have escaped the impious
    hands of \[his\] relations” (*dictator rem publicam constituas
    oportet, si impias propinquorum manus effugeris*). However, as
    Zetzel 1995, 229, *ad loc*., points out, Cicero rather
    “anachronistically introduces a phrase that gained constitutional
    significance only in his own lifetime.” It is interesting to note –
    as Hurlet 1993, 95, n.6 does – that this “expression is not attested
    outside of Cicero” (*expression n’est attestée que chez Cicéron*).

[^111]: See Cooley 2009, 114, *ad loc*., stating that “\[t\]his phrase
    echoes the official title given to the triumvirate of Octavian,
    Antony, and Lepidus, as illustrated on *denarii* minted in Africa
    *c.* 40-37 BC, which depict…Octavian on their reverse, with the
    words CAESAR IMP(erator) III VIR R(ei) P(ublicae) C(onstituedae)
    (*BM Coins*, *Rom*. *Rep*. II 579 nos. 29-31).”

[^112]: *OLD*, s.v. *detrimentum*: “**1** Material reduction,
    diminishment.”

[^113]: *OLD*, s.v. *detero*.

[^114]: Lange 2009, 18-19. See also Bringmann 1988 and Wallman 1989,
    *passim*, for a comprehensive study on the second triumvirate’s
    self-presentation and propaganda.

[^115]: The primary meaning of *consitutio*, according to the *OLD*, is
    “**1** Physical arrangement, disposition, structure; position,
    placing (in a scheme); **b** organization, arrangement, disposing
    (or affairs); an organized state.”

[^116]: See Hurlet 1993, 95, stating that “*rem publicam constituere*
    refers to both the founding of cities and establishing laws;
    furthermore, it does not strictly recover the theoretical
    constructions of philosophers – essentially that of Plato, to whom
    Cicero is constantly looking – but has a concrete meaning and still
    applies to constitutions and real states. *Rem publicam constituere*
    must be translated not as ‘to draft a fictional constitution’ but as
    ‘to give foundation (a constitution) to the State’” (rem publicam
    constituere *désigne à la fois la fondation de cités et
    l’établissement de lois; en outre, elle ne recouvre pas formellement
    les constructions théoriques des philosophes – essentiellement celle
    de Platon, à laquelle pense constamment Cicéron – mais possède un
    sens concret et s’applique toujours aux constitutions et aux Etats
    réels.* Rem publicam constituere *doit donc être traduit non pas par
    ‘rédiger une constitution fictive’ mais par ‘donner des fondements
    (une constitution) à l’Etat*’). See also Fleury 1990, 55, noting in
    his commentary on Book 1 of Vitruvius’ *De architectura* that
    “*constituere* is used to talk about the organization of a province
    by a magistrate invested with *imperium*” (constituere *s’emploie
    aussi pour parler de l’organisation d’une province par un magistrate
    muni de l’*imperium).
