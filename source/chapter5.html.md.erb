subtitle: The “Failure” of <em>Monumenta</em> in the <em>Aeneid</em>
---

The previous chapter examined several examples of “failed” architecture
in the *Aeneid*. These included in particular the constructed caves and
the artful labyrinths meant to cover over and contain chaotic forces and
elements of the past that would upset any established order imposed upon
them. It is now time to see what this analysis brings to bear on how one
might understand the *monumenta* in the poem and ultimately the
monumental architexture of epic itself.

Part 1 of this chapter will analyze three of the poem’s *monumenta*,
namely, those on Crete that Anchises mentions in Book 3, those embodied
by the Minotaur in Book 6, and those at the site of Rome that Evander
shows to Aeneas in Book 8. By putting these *monumenta* within the
context of the other architectural structures of the poem discussed in
Chapter IV it becomes possible to see that they too are often
unsuccessful in achieving a stable meaning, revealing the “cracks” in
their epistemological foundations.[^336] These “failed” monuments should
alert the reader to the instability of meaning inherent to monuments
that has the potential to upset any stable narrative of the past (and
future) that the monuments of the Augustan age – whether Augustus’ or
that of the *Aeneid* itself – might try to establish.

Part 2 will then build upon the conclusions reached regarding
architectural boundaries and monuments in the poem in order to arrive at
a definition of Vergil’s own architexture. Whereas Horace sought to
stabilize the borders of his genre while subtly introducing extrageneric
and novel material, Vergil’s poem shows us in contrast how the external
facade of epic that he places upon his story of Rome is unstable: his
epic frame cannot ultimately keep the chaotic forces of the Roman past
from breaking through and disrupting a tidy teleological narrative from
Aeneas to Augustus. An analysis of the *monumenta* on the Baldric of
Pallas – read often as a *mise-en*-*abyme* for the poem itself – will
serve to weave together the threads of thought from the preceding
section and allow us to arrive at some general conclusions regarding the
poem’s overall architextural structure. Like the frame of the baldric, I
propose, the poem as a monument of Roman history fails to contain the
chaos (actual and epistemological) that is a significant component of
Rome’s story as Vergil tells it – a failure that is most apparent when
Aeneas slaughters the injured and defenseless Turnus after seeing the
baldric. It might then appear based on this reading that the *Aeneid*
itself is just as much a “failed” *monumentum* as the ones that it
contains.

Yet, as I argue in Part 3, it is the very “failure” of the *Aeneid* as a
monument that perhaps makes it a monumental success in the way in which
the poem causes its readers to reflect upon the nature of monuments.
What the *Aeneid* suggests is not that the instability of meaning makes
all *monumenta* failures, *per se*, but that to appreciate a monument
fully and learn all it has to tell us about the past we need be aware of
the multiplicity of meanings that lie underneath what appears on its
magnificent exterior. It is in this way, in fact, that I argue the poem
can illustrate for its readers that the very power of a monument
actually lies not only in its apparent stability (literal and
epistemological) that Horace stressed, but also in the awareness on the
part of the spectator of the monument’s capacity to fail – without which
the “immortality” that a monument promises would have little meaning. As
I suggest in concluding, moreover, this same polysemy of monuments did
not escape Augustus, either, in his use of monuments in the *Res Gestae*
to remember Rome’s own chaotic past – good and bad – while
simultaneously giving his subjects hope for a better present and future.
The nuanced way that the *princeps* describes the Temple of Janus in
particular provides an interesting parallel to the sophisticated
architextural *monumentum* that the *Aeneid* represents.

###Part 1. Vergilian *Monumenta*###

The previous chapter briefly mentioned the *monumenta* that Evander
shows to Aeneas in Book 8. These are the only *monumenta* in the poem
that are strictly architectural. At the same time, though, the poem is
filled with several non-architectural *monumenta* that require attention
for understanding what kind of monument the epic poem itself can be said
to represent.[^337] This part of the present chapter will analyze a few
of the most important *monumenta* in the poem before turning at last to
the structures found at the proto-Rome of Evander. This brief survey
will demonstrate not only that these monuments “fail” to maintain a
stable meaning; it will also show, more importantly, that this
instability of meaning leads to the kind of chaos and *errores* of the
past that the failed structures examined in Chapter IV also could not
contain.

The very first time that word *monumentum* appears in the poem should
not inspire confidence in the reader for the ability of “monuments” to
present a stable and unambiguous meaning. When the Trojans are trying to
decode Apollo’s prophecy that they should “seek their ancient mother”
(*antiquam exquirite matrem*, *Aen*. 3.96), Anchises calls upon
*monumenta* in order to find a solution to the puzzle:

> tum genitor ueterum uoluens monumenta uirorum
> "audite, o proceres," ait "et spes discite uestras.
> Creta Iouis magni medio iacet insula ponto,
> mons ldaeus ubi et gentis cunabula nostrae. (*Aen*. 3.102-1065
>
> “Hear me, leaders,” said my father, revolving in his mind the
> *monumenta* of ancient men, “and learn what you can hope for. Crete
> lies in the middle of the sea, the island of mighty Jove, where there
> exists a Mt. Ida and the cradle of our race.

Aeneas’ father advises the Trojans to go to Crete where they can find
their origins, that is, their *cunabula* (“cradle,” 105). This is the
place, Anchises continues, where Cybele’s cult originated with its
brazen symbols (cf. 3.111). The founder of Troy himself first came from
this island, too – if Anchises remembers correctly (*si rite audita
recordor*, 107) – and “therefore” (*ergo*, 114) it must be where the
Trojans should found their city. This is not the right interpretation of
Apollo’s prophecy, of course. What one should note here is the fact that
it is specifically *monumenta* that cause Anchises to make such a
mistake. They lead him and his fellow Trojans, in other words, to
continue the *errores* that they have endured to that point since
departing from the shores of Troy.

The very first set of *monumenta* in the poem is thus a “failure.”
Anchises’ mistake illustrates for the reader not just that monuments
fail to provide their interpreters with a clear message; more than that,
the failure here demonstrates that these structures can mislead their
interpreters, too, as happens with the Trojans when they try impose
their own meanings and desires upon them. The passage suggests, in other
words, that the failure of a monument to achieve a single, stable
meaning allows for the weary Trojans to fit these monuments – regardless
of their original meaning – into an interpretation that on the one hand
suits their desire for a new home, but on the other is still geared to
their past and thus leads them away from arriving at their new
future.[^338]

An even more complicated “monument” is the one which the labyrinth on
Daedalus’ Doors both hides and makes its viewers remember, namely, the
Minotaur represented in the carvings and labeled as the *Veneris
monumenta nefandae* (*Aen*. 6.21),[^339] as discussed in the previous
chapter.[^340] These *monumenta* are of particular importance since they
present in an explicit way both the attempt to control the past through
monumental structures and the failure of that effort.[^341] Here is the
passage again in full:

> hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
> Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
> Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
> hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.
>
> magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
> Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
> caeca regens filo uestigia. (*Aen*. 6.25-31)
>
> Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
> beneath [it] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
> the Minotaur, the *monumenta* of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
> that toil of the house and the inescapable *error*. But indeed
> Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen’s great love unlocks the
> tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.

To label the Minotaur as the “*monumenta* of a criminal Venus” would
seem to exonerate Daedalus in the narrative he presents. As William
Fitzgerald has suggested, in fact, the “configuration is notable for its
absolute lack of Daedalus, who does not feature in Pasiphae’s
escapade.”[^342] Indeed, although the master craftsman was the one who
built the cow which allowed Pasiphae to copulate with the bull, he
appears nowhere in this part of the doorframe. By presenting the story
in this way, then, Daedalus is able to elide his own role from the
Minotaur’s conception – making the creature the fault of a
*Veneris...nefandae* (27). At the same time, however, by representing
the Minotaur at all the artist fails to keep hidden the horrors of his
own past. Instead of allowing this evil to lie concealed in the past
Daedalus instead monumentalizes it for all to see and thus forever keeps
his own *errores* on display regardless of the label that is given to
the creature.[^343] The architect cannot escape from the horrible
mistakes of his past even by providing a frame that re-interprets them
in a way more sympathetic to him. Aestheticizing the past through
*monumenta* cannot fully hide Daedalus’ mistakes, in other words, no
matter how brilliant and mesmerizing those monumental golden doors
appear.

Before we move on to examining the *monumenta* of proto-Rome it seems
relevant to note that while Daedalus’ selective depiction of the past
can only be inferred from the passage discussed above, it becomes
abundantly clear in the way that the master craftsman depicts (or rather
does not depict) his dead son Icarus on the same doors.

> ...Tu quoque magnam
> partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes.
> bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro,
> bis patriae cecidere manus… (*Aen*. 6.30-33)
>
> You too would have an important part in so great a work, Icarus, were
> grief to allow it. Twice [Daedalus] had tried to fashion your fall
> in gold, twice the father’s hands fell…

In this passage Vergil explicitly tells the reader that Daedalus cannot
fashion the fall of his son – an incident that is the fault of his
creations yet again – for his hands cannot but fall (cf. *cecidere*, 33)
when he tries to complete the frame.[^344] But Icarus is there,
nonetheless, brought before the readers’ eyes by the poet himself
through an apostrophe to the fallen boy.[^345] Whereas the absence of
Daedalus from the frames above goes unmentioned by the poet, this final
scene demonstrates more explicitly the way that the ingenious inventor
is ultimately not able to keep hidden in his art the mistakes of his
past. The conspicuous absence of Icarus that the poet notes transforms
the doors into a monument not just to Daedalus’ dead son but also to the
pain that he felt at having lost him. Vergil thus monumentalizes
Daedalus’ grief for his son – even when it was the intention of the
Athenian inventor to leave out of the frame the fall that he had caused
for the pain it would bring him to reproduce it.

By representing his story in the pictorial medium Daedalus is able to
frame his past, giving it a kind of rigid structure. That does not mean,
though, that he can control what others read back into that fictional
frame. The events and details of his past that are not represented there
can be made present by its interpreters even when Deadalus does not
depict them – thus making it impossible for him to escape the past that
he would clearly rather forget.[^346] He can try all he might to give a
stable narrative to that past, to cover over its horrors in gold
carvings. Yet the *monumenta* that the Minotaur represents within these
frames can be read as symbolizing the *errores* of the artisan just as
readily as they can be interpreted as the fault of “Venus.” In other
words, the fact that the Minotaur is presented at all allows
interpreters to read back into the myth those very mistakes that
Daedalus might have wanted to leave out of his wondrous, intricate
construction. In the end, therefore, even a master craftsman such as
Daedalus is shown as unable to build a stable monument that would ease
his suffering.[^347] The surface meaning of the monument – as the
labyrinth itself – is not firm but can be broken down to reveal
additional meanings that lie beneath its resplendent, magnificent
surface.

The *monumenta* that Anchises uses to interpret the prophecy of Apollo
fail him, misleading him and his fellow Trojans into further *errores*.
The *monumenta* that the Minotaur represents fail to save Daedalus from
reliving his own *errores* of the past but instead perpetuate them. It
should be no surprise, then, when problems of interpretation also
accompany the only time when Vergil uses *monumenta* in an explicitly
architectural sense, namely, in his description of the place that will
one day become Rome.[^348] To whom are these structures “monuments”?
Evander sees them as meaning one thing, Aeneas perhaps as meaning
something else in his amazement. What about Roman readers, though? What
do these incredibly ancient *monumenta* mean to them? In the passages
analyzed below the problem is one a multiplicity of viewpoints that
confuse or at the very least destabilize the meaning that the
*monumenta* might have.

Vergil introduces Aeneas’ famous “tour” Rome in Book 8 of the poem with
the following passage:

> ...ibat rex obsitus aeuo
> et comitem Aenean iuxta natumque tenebat
> ingrediens uarioque uiam sermone leuabat.
> miratur facilisque oculos fert omnia circum
> Aeneas capiturque locis et singula laetus
> exquiritque auditque uirum monumenta priorum. (*Aen*. 8.307-312)
>
> The king went forth, besieged with age, and as he progressed he held
> Aeneas and his own son nearby as companions and lightened their way
> with various talk. Aeneas marvels and moves his eyes eagerly over all
> things. He is captivated by the places, happily asking and hearing one
> at a time about the *monumenta* of former men.

What is at first simply a way to lighten the journey through
conversation becomes something by which Aeneas is utterly “captivated”
(*capitur*, 311) as he marvels at what he sees – much as he did in front
of Daedalus’ Doors in Book 6.[^349] The difference in this case is that
he has a guide to explain the different “monuments of former men”
(*uirum monumenta priorum*, 312). But what exactly are these
*monumenta*? The first “monuments” that Evander mentions are merely
“groves” (*nemora*, *Aen*. 8.314) where the Nymphs and the first
inhabitants of the place dwelled. The Greek king then goes on for 28
lines to tell Aeneas about the way things used to be in the “golden age”
of Saturn, when no laws were needed and everything was in abundance,
before briefly explaining his own journey to the place itself and the
founding of his city.[^350] If Evander is also a recent immigrant,
though, how does he know the way things used to be in these lands which
seem uninhabited upon his arrival except for the monster Cacus discussed
in the previous chapter? Are these bare sites themselves all the
“evidence” that remains of these events? Although there is only a hint
of the ambiguity of meaning of these *monumenta* here, they set the tone
for the rest of the passage which is likewise filled with such problems
of perspective to an even greater degree.

In the intervening lines before Evander speaks again Vergil narrates
more of the tour that the king gives to Aeneas, pointing out several
more “monuments” along the way:

> …dehinc progressus monstrat et aram
> et Carmentalem Romani nomine portam
> quam memorant, nymphae priscum Carmentis honorem,
> uatis fatidicae, cecinit quae prima futuros
> Aeneadas magnos et nobile Pallanteum.
> hinc lucum ingentem, quem Romulus acer asylum
> rettulit...monstrat... (*Aen*. 8.337-343)
>
> Then having gone ahead he shows both the altar and the gate which the
> Romans call Carmental, the ancient honor of the Nymph Carmentis, the
> fate-speaking prophetess, who first sang that the sons of Aeneas would
> be great and Pallanteum would be noble. From this place he shows a
> vast grove, which the fierce Romulus restored as an asylum.

Evander shows Aeneas “the Carmentaline Gate” (*Carmentalem...portam*,
338) and the immense “grove” (*lucum*, 342) which Romulus would come to
use as an asylum. Yet these both appear to be anachronistic *monumenta*
at least from the way that Vergil describes them. The Carmentaline Gate
commemorates the “ancient honor” (*priscum...honorem*, 339) of the
*vates* Carmens who first sang about the great sons of Aeneas and noble
Pallanteum (the city that Evander and Aeneas are currently touring).
While this edifice is thus a typical *monumentum* in the sense that it
commemorates someone in the past, it is hard to know whether these words
are Vergil’s commentary or a paraphrase of Evander’s own description.
Does the king himself know that Carmens actually sang about the
*Aeneadae*? It would seem likely since she is his mother, after all (cf.
*Aen*. 8.335-336). If he does know of this prophecy, though, it would
surely be strange that he has not already mentioned it to Aeneas and his
*Aeneadae*. But regardless of whether or not this is Vergil’s paraphrase
of Evander’s own words Aeneas is surely not seeing this *monumentum* in
the same way as a Roman reader would from the future. The meaning of the
monument for him (and Evander) is different from what it would have
meant to Vergil’s Roman readers, who might know of these prophecies and
their ultimate fulfillment from their perspective in the future.

Admittedly, there might still be a certain amount of ambiguity regarding
how much Evander knows about the Carmentaline Gate: he might know about
the prophecy, or he might not. Any such uncertainty of how much
knowledge Evander has of the “monuments” that he is showing to Aeneas
disappears completely in the case of the second *monumentum* mentioned
in this passage, namely, the asylum of Romulus. There is simply no way
that Evander could know of Romulus; for the Greek ex-pat, at least, the
grove can only be notable (if at all) because of its great size
(*ingentem*, 342). And the same no doubt goes for Aeneas’ interpretation
of this “monument,” as well. Only a reader of the epic would be able to
interpret this grove for its historical value. This is not the only time
on Evander’s tour that the reader encounters such an ambiguity of
meaning between Rome’s past and present:

> hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolia ducit
> aurea nunc, olim siluestribus horrida dumis. (*Aen*. 8.347-348)
>
> [Evander] leads [Aeneas] from here to the Tarpeian seat and the
> Capitoline, now golden, formerly bristling with forest-thorns.

The Tarpeian “seat” (*sedem*, 347) obviously cannot have any historical
value to Evander; it would be another 500 years before Tarpeia would
betray her city (cf. Liv. 1.11). And the Capitoline for the two of them
is merely “bristling with forest-thorns” (*siluestribus horrida dumis*,
348). This is not the case for a Roman reader, however, who as Vergil
points out would have associated the Capitoline with the “now golden”
(*aurea nunc*, 348) roofs of its buildings.[^351]

There are clearly some strange anachronisms that emerge from this
passage.[^352] Vergil’s Augustan readers do not see the *monumenta* that
Aeneas and Evander do in both a physical and historical sense.[^353] Yet
Aeneas is said to “marvel” (*miratur*) at them – whatever they are – and
“happily” (*laetus*, 8.311), too. Evander’s tour thus illustrates not
only the way that *monumenta* can change meaning depending on their
viewer; just as important, these passages shows that ignorance of what a
monument means does not stop a viewer from enjoying them – as was noted
above, for example, with the Trojans’ fateful enjoyment of the
monumental Horse in Book II.[^354]

It is the perspective of the viewer that ultimately gives these
monuments their meaning(s). This is not say that these architectural
“monuments” are “failures” in quite as an explicitly negative way as
either the *monumenta* that Anchises (mis)remembers or the ones that
Daedalus carves. The *monumenta* that Evander shows to Aeneas amaze and
inspire the Trojan leader, after all. Nevertheless, when one takes into
account the failures of the architectural structures analyzed in
previous chapter and those of the *monumenta* in this chapter, it would
not seem inappropriate to read the ambiguity of meaning that Evander’s
“monuments” present in a less than positive light, as well. Although
their external appearance (or name) might suggest a certain association,
such an association is particular to the perspective of the onlooker –
whether as a character in the poem, the narrator, or the reader. And
different “readers” (including Aeneas and Evander) will no doubt bring
their own interpretations. It is certainly the case, for instance, that
the tour means something very different to a modern reader from what it
might have meant to one who lived in Rome at the time that Vergil was
writing.

What these scenes from Evander’s tour therefore demonstrate to their
readers is the way that architectural *monumenta* can amaze even when
the audience does not fully understand what they mean. It would seem
that sometimes only the outward appearance of monumentality – regardless
of its meaning or what it commemorates – is enough for a structure to
make an impact on its audience, or simply to appear monumental. Where
these monuments “fail” is in the sense that without the proper knowledge
of the past (or in Evander and Aeneas’ case the future) such structures
or places can amaze but cannot impart the meaning they were perhaps
meant to commemorate, whether good or bad.[^355] Without their stories
these monuments still manage through their external appearance to cause
their audiences to consider the significance of these spaces, even if
only to be in awe of them; where they “fail” is in their inability to
keep a stable frame on prior events which can help one to avoid
repeating past *errores*. Who built the *monumenta* that Evander shows
to Aeneas, one may ask, and more importantly what happened to them and
their civilization so that all they leave behind in Evander’s time are
these monumental “relics” (*reliquas*, 8.356)?[^356] Might it be that
Rome could one day return to ruins whose original meaning no one would
know? These are the kinds of questions that are raised when one
considers these *monumenta* in the context of the other “failed”
structures that the poem contains.

The *Aeneid* has been shown in this chapter and the last one to be full
of monumental structures whose very boundaries are revealed to be
unstable, epistemologically as much as physically. Their awe-inspiring
surfaces can cause one to forget what one should remember; or put in
another way, their magnificent frames can keep hidden – and thus alive –
that which one might want to forget. The same can be said for the
architexture of the poem itself, as the next part of this chapter will
now suggest.

###Part 2. Vergilian Architexture: Fractured Frames of Meaning###

The architecture in the *Aeneid* – both in its failed constructions and
ambiguous *monumenta* – sets the foundation for a much different kind of
architexture for Vergil than for Horace in his *Odes*. The epic poet
focuses not so much on how to bring new elements into his generic
boundaries without destabilizing them as on what happens when one tries
to frame the violence and chaos of the past – and, in particular, Rome’s
past – within the grand and monumental structure of epic that the proem
of *Georgics* 3 suggested the *Aeneid* might be.[^357] As the balance of
this chapter will show, however, the poem’s apparent failure in this
regard is not nearly so important as the sophisticated representation of
that failure which the *Aeneid* provides – as well as the lessons it can
thereby offer to its readers, ancient and modern.

The analysis of architecture and monuments in this chapter and the last
one has demonstrated two issues that might arise when one attempts to
construct an epic poem as a frame for the chaotic forces that are a part
of Rome’s story from the start. Architectural constructions are
repeatedly shown, on the one hand, as a means to contain chaotic forces
of Rome’s past that would upset any order which one might try to impose
upon them – and they are repeatedly shown to fail at keeping such forces
restrained and hidden. The artificial boundaries placed upon the fury of
the winds, the Greeks, and Cacus are ultimately broken and release such
forces to wreak havoc on the world of Rome’s origins. Even the labyrinth
(whether metaphoric or real) is shown to be ineffectual at keeping at
bay such forces permanently – not only distracting the onlooker from the
chaos contained through the complex artistry of its structure, but also
forever monumentalizing the *errores* of the past in its shifting
architectural frame that cannot be controlled.

It is not just the chaos under the surface, on the other hand, that
Vergil is bringing to light in the *Aeneid*. The poem’s failed
*monumenta* also bring one’s attention to the problems with the
magnificent frames placed upon such destructive forces. Neither those
who produce nor those who receive such *monumenta* can give them a
stable meaning which will endure. There are some meanings, moreover,
that simply cannot be contained – even if one wants to forget them.
Horace’s poetry showed how two opposed meanings can create a tension
that allows a structure to evolve without its traditional boundaries
being compromised. If a *monumentum* can have two meanings at once,
however, who is to say it cannot have even more meanings – many more
meanings – so many that those stable boundaries begin to crack?[^358]
Vergil’s *Aeneid* suggests a possible answer to that question. Its epic
surface no matter how grand it might appear cannot in the end provide a
stable frame for the chaos that inhabits Rome’s past and haunts its
present.

These two issues – the inefficacy of an epic frame to contain the
destructive forces of the past and to maintain a single, stable meaning
– are brought together in the poem’s final set of *monumenta*: the
Baldric of Pallas. This object has also been seen as a *mise-en-abyme*
of the poem itself in a way not dissimilar to Horace’s *monumentum* in
the finale of his first collection of *Odes*.[^359] The belt is not
architectural, of course. It does further illustrate, however, the way
that a monument’s lack of stability in terms of its meaning can lead men
to commit the same violent mistakes of the past by releasing the violent
forces that it both commemorates and tries to frame. Its frame is
revealed to be just as susceptible to “collapse,” in fact, as the
boundaries of Aeolus’ Cave, the Trojan Horse, the Cave of Cacus, or the
poem’s labyrinths – and with similar disastrous results when those
boundaries fail. The baldric is “unique,” moreover, in that it is the
only set of *monumenta* described at length in the poem that is also (in
terms of its content at least) a part of an actual architectural
monument in Augustan Rome, namely, the relief of the Danaids in the
portico of Apollo’s temple on the Palatine.[^360] For these reasons,
then, an analysis of the baldric’s *monumenta* will serve as a fitting
way to conclude this investigation and come to some conclusions
regarding Vergil’s monumental and “failed” architexture.

When Turnus begs for his life after being wounded by Aeneas at the very
end of the poem the Trojan leader hesitates for a moment (*cunctantem*,
*Aen*. 12.940) as the words of the fallen native Italian begin to sway
him to take pity. It is at that moment, however, that Aeneas sees that
Turnus is wearing Pallas’ baldric – the sign of the enemy side
(*inimicum insigne*, 12.944) – which Turnus not only took from the son
of Evander after slaying him without mercy, but which he also
re-appropriated for his own use. The sight of this piece of armor causes
a strong reaction in Aeneas, as Vergil describes in the epic’s famous
final lines:

> ille, oculis postquam saeui monumenta doloris
> exuuiasque hausit, furiis accensus et ira
> terribilis: tune hinc spoliis indute meorum
> eripiare mihi? Pallas te hoc uulnere, Pallas
> immolat et poenam scelerato ex sanguine sumit."
> hoc dicens ferrum aduerso sub pectore condit
> feruidus; ast illi soluuntur frigore membra
> uitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras. (*Aen*. 12.945-952)
>
> \[Aeneas\], after he drank in the *monumenta* of savage grief and the
> spoils with his eyes, inflamed with furies and terrible in his wrath:
> “Will you be snatched away from me while dressed in the spoils of my
> own people? Pallas sacrifices you with this wound, Pallas exacts
> payment from your wicked blood.” Saying this, in a rage, he founds his
> sword in the opposed chest. Turnus’ limbs are loosened with cold and
> angrily his life flees with a groan down into the shadows.

These *monumenta* represent the most complex set of “monuments” in the
poem. Even more than with any of the monuments examined above there are
in this passage multiple potential viewers and multiple people/events
that the *monumenta* might be commemorating.[^361] First of all, for
Aeneas, the baldric is a reminder not only of Pallas himself, but also
of the “savage grief” (*saeui...doloris*, 945) that he feels at Turnus’
act of slaying the young Greek.[^362] For Turnus, on the other hand,
these are “spoils” (*exuuias*, 946; *spoliis*, 947) in which he formerly
“rejoices and takes delight” (*ouat...gaudetque*, *Aen*. 10.500) when he
rips them from Pallas’ dead body in Book 10; they are from his
perspective simply a sign of his own military prowess. Turnus thus
clearly interprets these *monumenta* rather differently from Aeneas. Yet
there is another perspective to consider here, namely, that of the poet
himself. When Turnus picks up the baldric in Book 10 the poet intrudes
to lament humankind’s ignorance of the future:

> nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae
> et seruare modum rebus sublata secundis!
> Turno tempus erit magna cum optauerit emptum
> intactum Pallanta et cum spolia ista diemque

These “spoils” (*spolia*, 504) that for Turnus brought him such delight
will soon cause him to regret his decision to strip Pallas’ corpse for
plunder – let alone kill him in the first place. The poet’s lament for
the inability of mortals to know the consequences of their actions here
thus signals once again the inability of *monumenta* to maintain a
stable meaning: the future will bring different viewers and thereby
different interpretations to a single object – and this makes it
impossible for that object have a single, stable way of understanding of
it. The epistemological boundaries of these *monumenta* are not stable,
in other words, but are constantly being broken down, re-interpreted,
and built back up depending on the viewer.[^363]

There is still at least one more very important level, however, on which
to interpret the *monumenta* of the baldric – one that has great
significance for how to understand both its inability to keep in check
the chaotic forces of the past and its instability of meaning. Vergil’s
phrasing is somewhat ambiguous when he describes Aeneas’ actions as the
Trojan hero looks at the baldric. As scholars have noted, the *saeui
monumenta doloris* (945) that he takes in through his eyes can also
refer to the images which have been engraved on the baldric.[^364] The
reader is aware of the scene depicted on the sword-belt because when
Turnus first strips the piece of armor from the dead Pallas the poet
enters into a brief ecphrasis on its decoration:

> …exanimem rapiens immania pondera baltei
> impressumque nefas: una sub nocte iugali
> caesa manus iuuenum foede thalamique cruenti,
> quae Clonus Eurytides multo caelauerat auro;
> quo nunc Turnus ovat spolio gaudetque potitus. (*Aen*. 10.496-500)
>
> …snatching the heavy weight of the baldric and the sin pressed upon
> it: during the course of a single wedding night a band of young men
> slain in sin and marriage chambers bloodied, which events Clonus, son
> of Eurytus, had engraved in much gold. And it is in this set of spoils
> which Turnus now rejoices and takes pleasure having obtained them.

The baldric frames the story of the Danaids who killed their husbands on
their wedding night. Much scholarly attention has been given to the
details of this description – and, in particular, its relation to the
actual monument on the Palatine in Augustan Rome mentioned above which
presents the same myth.[^365] The point I want to emphasize, however, is
that Turnus does not seem to realize that by taking up the baldric he is
also taking up “the sin pressed upon it” (*rapiens immania pondera
baltei* / *impressumque nefas*, 10.496-497). His interpretation of the
baldric as a set of spoils (*spolio*, 500) does not see past the thick
layer of gold (*multo...auro*, 499) that frames – and thus in a sense
covers over – the brutality of what is depicted. When Aeneas sees the
baldric, though, he is said to “drink in with his eyes the *monumenta*
of the cruel grief *and* the spoils” (cf. *oculis postquam saeui
monumenta doloris* / *exuuiasque hausit*, 12.945-946), which suggests a
different and more penetrating reading than seeing them only as
*spolia*.[^366] Could it be that the savagery of events depicted stirs
him to reject pity and slay the subdued Turnus?[^367] That is certainly
not excluded by Vergil’s vague wording here.[^368] I would suggest that
the poet allows for a reading of the scene whereby Aeneas is himself
reading in the violence depicted on the baldric a reminder (or
“monument”) to violence which then stirs him to take Turnus’ life.[^369]

The *monumenta* of the baldric – whether the sword-belt itself or the
images depicted on it – clearly do not have one stable meaning; they
change meaning, rather, depending on who sees them and what exactly that
viewer sees. These several, often competing meanings cause readers to
re-evaluate constantly the boundaries of any single interpretation. The
baldric thus very clearly “fails” as a monument in two related ways. It
cannot maintain a single meaning, on the one hand, as Turnus cannot
control the meaning of the baldric, and Aeneas cannot see the object
without unleashing the violence it commemorates, whether intentionally
or not.[^370] By looking at the play between surface and meaning, on the
other hand, we can see that the baldric also fails to contain the chaos
it depicts on it resplendent, golden exterior. The artistry of the frame
does not matter: in the *Aeneid*, at least, that which bounds the fury
inherent to Rome’s origins is shown as susceptible to collapse – and
thereby to release the chaos inside. And for that reason Aeneas’
violence-inducing interpretation of the baldric becomes perhaps the
perfect way for Vergil to end his poem.[^371] It makes the baldric
emblematic, I would argue, of a structure that pervades and perhaps even
mirrors the entire poem, as the epic too fails to aestheticize in an
unambiguous way the destruction and violent chaos of Rome’s past within
its beautiful, highly-wrought, “golden” frame.[^372] What remains inside
it is not a single truth but a chaotic force – one that not only breaks
through the frame of the fiction that contains it to affect Aeneas but
at the same time also reveals the fiction that any frame can safely
contain such fury.[^373]

###Part 3. Reading Beneath the Surface of Augustan Monuments###

Vergilian architexture is not so much about what a genre claims to
exclude as what it can include – or rather tries to contain. Certain
chaotic forces of Rome’s past cannot be tamed by an attempt to give them
a facade of epic that seeks to frame those forces. This does not
necessarily mean, however, that the poem is criticizing the grand
monuments of the Augustan age as pure propaganda which needs to be seen
through to the chaotic past they hide.[^374] Such an interpretation of
the poem takes away from the complexity of meaning that the *Aeneid*
highlights in dealing with monuments. The poem might suggest that there
is something sinister lurking behind those glorious, travertine facades
in Rome, something in the past that should not be forgotten lest it
return to wreak havoc on the present. But it does so, I would argue, in
order to make its readers into more effective readers of that past and
better caretakers of their own future – not merely to destabilize the
meaning of the present.

The poem helps its readers (ancient and modern) to understand more fully
what monuments can accomplish even in their apparent “failure.”
Monuments allow us, on the one hand, to move into the future without
forgetting the mistakes we have made in the past; that is often a
significant part of their purpose, after all, according to Françoise
Choay in her seminal study on the idea of monument in modernity.[^375]
What the *Aeneid* shows us, on the other hand, is how the very failure
of a monument to maintain a specific meaning and/or to conceal the
horrors of the past can (paradoxically perhaps) achieve a similar
effect: by exposing readers to such failures, by showing them the
“cracks” in the facade of the epic structure, the poem is not claiming
that monuments are useless; on the contrary, the *Aeneid* urges its
readers through its failed architecture (and architexture) to see the
need for understanding the flaws and limitations of such structures if
one is to gain anything from them.

The poem is therefore not quite demonstrating only the “impossibility of
dictating artistic interpretation,” as Shadi Bartsch has
suggested.[^376] Nor does it merely show the dangers of forgetting the
past.[^377] The *Aeneid* should not be seen, moreover, as presenting
only a complementary narrative to the monuments of the Augustan age
because its “fictional framework allows a broader perspective on Roman
history than the propagandistic monument.”[^378] Vergil crafts a
*monumentum* whose architexture can both celebrate the past and the
future while simultaneously making its readers aware *through* its
failure of the *errores* of that past and the chaos that could break out
at any moment in that future.[^379] It is thus very similar to the
Temple of Janus that Jupiter describes in Book 1 of the poem: the Temple
is also a monument that celebrates the current peace not by eradicating
the *furor* of Rome’s past but by bounding it within its doors – gates
barred tightly with iron, yes, but ones which also have the potential to
be re-opened at any moment, releasing the chaos from the past that they
contain.

The poem can thus even become a *monumentum* that represents in its
“failure” a strategy for interpreting other monuments of the Augustan
age, as well. Augustus was certainly not ignorant of the sorts of
problems that accompany the use of monuments. Chapter III has already
suggested that the *princeps* presents a highly sophisticated
understanding of the idea of the monument in his own *Res Gestae* that
parallels Horace’s own complex use of the idea in the *Odes*.[^380] A
similar case can be made here by examining other sections of Augustus’
monumental inscription about his achievements. It is noteworthy, for
instance, to look at what Augustus has to say regarding that same Temple
of Janus mentioned several times throughout the past two chapters:

> \[Ianum\] Quirin\[um quem cl\[laussum ess\[e maiores nostri
> voluer\]runt, cum \[p\]er totum i\[mperium pop\]uli Roma\[ni terra
> marique es\]set parta victoriis pax, cum, pr\[iusquam\] nascerer, \[a
> condita\] u\[rb\]e bis omnino clausum \[f\]uisse prodatur
> m\[emori\]ae, ter me princi\[pe senat\]us claudendum esse censui\[t\].
> (*RGDA* 13)
>
> Although before I was born it is said that the temple of Janus
> Quirinus had been closed twice since the founding of the city – a
> temple which our ancestors wanted to be closed whenever peace had been
> won by victories through the whole empire of the Roman people on both
> land and sea – while I was *princeps* the senate ordered that it
> should be closed three times.

The point here is not just that Augustus has established peace more
times during his rule alone than in all of Roman history combined. That
is what the words say, of course. As the present study of the *Aeneid*
has shown, however, monuments have a meaning beneath their surfaces, as
well. Closing the doors does not mean that *furor* is gone forever; it
is trapped, rather, and that should not be forgotten. Just as important
as how many times Augustus has closed the doors is the fact that Rome
has been at war for almost its entire history. *Furor* has always been a
part of Rome’s story – the *Aeneid* demonstrates that aspect of its
history again and again in a time before Rome the city even existed.
Augustus does not mention explicitly this fact but instead focuses on
the positive: his birth signifies a new age where peace is finally
possible.[^381] Again that does not mean that *Furor* has been
eliminated, as even under Augustus’ reign the gates were closed and then
re-opened.[^382] Yet it is that very acknowledgement – that Rome could
fall into chaos again – which gives Augustus’ statement even more
significance and power for his Roman readers. To close the gates so many
times signifies a new age where peace can finally happen; the horrors of
the past are still there, though, within the walls of the structure – no
matter how grand it is, no matter how tightly shut it may be – ready to
burst out at any moment.

Reading Augustus’ words in this way suggests that while the *princeps*
alone has been able to control and contain the *Furor* of Rome’s past,
that containment might not last forever. It is precisely because this
situation may only be temporary, though, that Romans therefore need
Augustus (or his successor) to continue to be their *princeps* and keep
chained the *Furor* of their past as Romans. And so it is to the
Augustus’ advantage as well as their own for the readers of the *Res
Gestae* and their newly monumental city to be able to see past the
exterior of the temple and its closed doors, to be able to imagine the
chaos that resides inside the architectural monument, that is, at least
for the moment.

It is possible to detect a similar destabilization of the surface in
other Augustan monuments. The Ara Pacis has a much greater effect on its
audience, for instance, when rather than seen as covering over the
horrors of the recent past of civil strife such *errores* are imagined
to exist right below its marble surface in such a way that the glorious
present and future can be set in relief against them.[^383] Peace and
concord mean much more, after all, when set against war and conflict. No
one should blame Augustus for not depicting the horrors of Rome’s recent
civil wars on Augustan monuments any more than anyone should criticize
Daedalus for not carving his son’s death (for which he had some
responsibility) on the doors of the temple of Apollo.[^384] What the
*Aeneid* demonstrates is how to look at what is not on the surface, as
in the case of Daedalus’ failed *monumenta*, and to see what might be
hard to take in but which is important not to forget lest Romans make
the same mistakes again. Even when the chaos of the past is framed
within Augustan architecture – as in the case of the Danaid friezes of
his Temple of Apollo,[^385] or the depiction of a bound *Furor* in his
own forum[^386] – those monuments gain more importance when seen not as
merely portrayals of triumph over chaos but as reminders that such chaos
could break free of its frame at any moment if Romans become complacent
in times of peace and order. The poem shows its readers a way to
interpret *monumenta* whereby one can be aware of their magnificent
surfaces – of the order that they attempt to give to the events of
history – and at the same time can understand that such frames do not
tell the entire story, that it is the interpreter’s own task to inquire
into the past, confronting head-on former *errores* and horrors of that
past to understand how to keep them from repeating.

**Ara Pacis (Rome, Italy)**

<br>

I am not claiming that Vergil and Augustus were alone in having this
perspective on monumental discourse of the Augustan age.[^387] Their
fellow Romans could hardly turn a corner in the city without coming
“face to face with the visual evidence of the contradictions and
paradoxes which underlay the imperial system,” as the city of Rome was
certainly “a realm of multiple perspectives and dramatic
collisions.”[^388] Nor were historians such as Livy and elegiac poets
such as Propertius unaware of the multiplicity of meaning that is
inherent to monuments.[^389] What I am suggesting are the ways that the
*Aeneid* is further exploring an element of monumental discourse in the
Augustan age – one which can be found in the *Res Gestae* of Augustus
himself – not inventing it wholesale, but both shaping it and being
influenced by it.

The *Aeneid* is a text that enwraps Rome’s past in an epic facade. It
fails to accomplish this completely, however, letting the chaos that is
a part of the Roman past break out at certain points in the poem,
whether it be the winds of Aeolus or the Greeks in the Horse, whether it
be the fury of the Trojan women on Sicily or the rage of Aeneas that
ends the poem. It is a *monumentum* that forces its readers to focus not
merely on what is on its surface but on what lies behind it, what past
monsters of *Furor* exist within its boundaries. This is not because it
seeks to undercut or “deconstruct” its facade – that would be a
simplistic way of understanding the poem’s complex monumental
architexture. The *Aeneid* shows its readers these “cracks” and allows
them then to gain a fuller appreciation of the peaceful stability that
Augustan monuments represent, as well as how fragile that peace can be
should they forget what lies behind their magnificent facades.

The *Aeneid* and its sophisticated architexture also points towards a
development in the modern understanding of the monument during the
twentieth century: an anxiety about what our monuments mean, or can
mean, when we somehow have to confront the horrors of the past while
still having hope that we can do better in our future.[^390] The poem
proves, on the one hand, that this need for a double perspective is not
just a modern phenomenon or problem. It does more, on the other hand,
than just point to this anxiety. The *Aeneid* demonstrates to its
readers, ancient and modern, that it is only by acknowledging the
capacity of monumental architecture to “fail” that we can truly
appreciate the service it provides for us.[^391] The poem does not
destabilize the meaning(s) that we give to monuments to no end by
showing the flaws in their epistemological foundations. It is rather by
showing “failure” to be inherent to the idea of the monument that the
*Aeneid* can demonstrate how monuments might help us come to grips with
our past – no matter how chaotic or full of violence – while also having
the belief that we can learn from our mistakes and thereby do better in
the present and future.[^392]

[^336]: Newlands 2002 deals similarly with the “fissures” and
    “fault-lines” in the boundaries of meaning in the Roman poetry under
    Domitian which – while mostly latent – have the potential to explode
    those boundaries (59).

[^337]: For discussions of the *monumenta* in the poem see Henry 1989,
    18-42 (“Chapter 2: Spoils, Gifts, and Memorials”), and Jaeger 1990,
    177-203 (“Chapter 7: Vergil’s *Aeneid* and the Campus Martius”). The
    ten times that Vergil uses the word *monumentum* (or *monimentum*)
    in the poem occur at: *Aen*. 3.102-105, 3.382-491, 4.494-499,
    5.535-538, 5.570-572, 6.24-27, 6.511-512, 8.310-312, 8.355-358, and
    12.945-949.

[^338]: See Quint 1982, 31, arguing that “Anchises’ misreading of the
    oracle of Delos which leads to the short-lived settlement on Crete –
    and the ways in which this episode is linked to others in Book 3 –
    indicate how an obsession with a former Troy threatens the Trojans’
    efforts to make a new beginning.”

[^339]: This is not the only time in the poem when *monumenta*
    commemorate something bad that one might wish to be hidden or
    forgotten. Other examples include the wounds that Deiphobus received
    from Helen (*Aen*. 6.511-512: *sed me fata mea et scelus exitiale
    Lacaenae* / *his mersere malis; illa haec monumenta reliquit*) and,
    of course, the savage acts of the Danaids depicted on the sword-belt
    of Pallas (*Aen*. 12.945: *saeui monumenta doloris*) that I will
    examine at length below. (On the former of these “monuments” see the
    discussion in Henry 1989, 37-38.)

[^340]: For further discussion of the labyrinthine meaning of this
    famous passage from Book 6 see pp. 131-134 above.

[^341]: See Jaeger 1997, 17, n.8, where she notes in her discussion of
    *monumenta* in Latin literature that “Daedalus constructed the
    impenetrable and inescapable labyrinth precisely to hide the
    offspring that preserved the evidence of Pasiphae’s shameful
    passion. The labyrinth itself is an enormous reminder built to
    counter and block the unforgettable product of bestiality.”

[^342]: Fitzgerald 1984, 54.

[^343]: Jaeger 1990, 177, also notes a “two-edged” nature of the
    Minotaur as *monumenta* in another sense, as “it both reminds men of
    the past and looks forward, suggesting that men (I should say women
    and bulls) cannot control the product of their actions, and that the
    product can both remind them of the deed and lead a horrible life of
    its own.”

[^344]: Traditionally, Daedalus was said to be able to bring his works
    of art to life (though Aristotle, *De an*. 1.3, appears skeptical in
    his reading of Democritus, who claims that the inventor brought his
    statues to life by pouring “liquid silver,” ἄργυρον χυτόν, into
    them). It is ironic, then, that he cannot even carve his own son who
    has died. See Morris 1992, 215-237 (“Chapter 8: Magic and
    Sculpture”), for a discussion of the power of Daedalus to bring his
    own statues to life. Morris attributes the metaphorical language
    used to describe Daedalus’ art and other objects with *daidal*-
    words in early Greek poetry as the source for the later idea that
    his works came to life. On the figure of Daedalus in Greco-Roman
    myth see also Frontisi-Ducroux 1975, McEwan 1993, 48-56, and
    Armstrong 2009, 80-83.

[^345]: See Bartsch 1998, 336, claiming that “the most important element
    of the Daedalian scene...\[is\] the way in which Icarus is *not*
    missing from this work. Another artist steps in to supply him, and
    that is Virgil, who apostrophizes him, and who, although Icarus is
    not on the frieze proper, brings him before us as reader-viewers via
    the same literary medium of epic as the rest of the frieze.”

[^346]: Frontisi-Ducroux 1975, 101-150, presents a detailed analysis of
    how every Daedalian answer (the pseudo-cow, the labyrinth, the wings
    of wax) serves as the grounds for another Daedalian problem (the
    minotaur, his prison, the death of his son).

[^347]: See Armstrong 2009, 82, claiming that “Daedalus’ ingenuity is
    not allowed to remain detached and impersonal; the craftsman’s own
    life and happiness is affected by the exercise of the very skills
    that define and distinguish him.”

[^348]: The poet uses the word *monumenta* twice during Aeneas’ tour of
    Rome: once in his narrative and once in the mouth of Evander, at
    *Aen*. 8.312 and 8.356, respectively.

[^349]: Cf. *Aen*. 6.33-37.

[^350]: Cf. *Aen*. 8.313-336. Edward 1996, 11, suggests that the “use of
    ruins” in this passage is “to evoke a superior past.” “These traces
    are a poignant reminder,” according to Edwards, “of the
    irrecoverability of the past, a sign of its profound absence. The
    age of Saturn, whose ruins still stand in Evander's proto-Rome, is a
    prelapsarian golden age which can never return.”

[^351]: As Bacon 1986, 328, notes, “\[t\]he boundaries between past and
    present are blurred as the splendors of

    Augustan Rome are superimposed on Evander’s primitive settlement.”
    For further discussion of this passage see Feeney 1992 \[1993\] and
    Edwards 1996, 31. See also Hopkins 2012 for a discussion of the
    Capitoline’s “monumentality” and its influence on the course of
    Rome’s architectural development.

[^352]: Wiseman 1984, 117-128, is not bothered by the bizarreness of
    this “double vision” (as the scholar calls it), but sees it rather
    as a very “skillful” superimposition of Augustan Rome on Evander’s
    city by the poet.

[^353]: Morwood 1991, 216, tries to solve this problem by suggesting
    that “\[f\]or Aeneas,” at least, “Rome is not a real city of bricks
    and mortar but a state of mind.”

[^354]: See pp. 106-115 above.

[^355]: Choay 2001 traces the idea that the definition of a monument has
    more to do with its “effect” than with what it commemorates to
    19<sup>th</sup>-century France after the Revolution, citing Quatremère de
    Quincy (1755-1849), whose definition of the word “monument”
    maintains that “the idea of *monument*, referring more to the effect
    of the edifice than to its intention or purpose, can suit and be
    applied to all types of building” (as cited in Choay 2001, 7). As
    the case of Aeneas in this passage suggests, however, the ancients
    could also clearly conceive of monuments based purely on the effect
    that certain buildings had on their spectators.

[^356]: Otis 1964 \[1995\], 337, suggests that these *monumenta* must be
    “relics of civilizations which grew out of the ruins of the golden
    age...and were in turn ruined by their own vices.”

[^357]: Cf. *G*. 3.8-16. See pp. 90-92 above for a brief discussion of
    this proem.

[^358]: Fowler 1990, 58, puts it well when he claims that “reality
    appears in the *Aeneid* as if reflected in a cracked mirror. It
    exists as many times over as there are active points of view.”

[^359]: Putnam 1994, 187, argues that “the description of the baldric is
    in certain key senses a synecdoche for the poem as a whole.”

[^360]: See Putnam 1994, 180, where he claims that the baldric is
    “unique” in that it was “the only one of the six Virgilian
    ekphraseis that reflects an actual work of art, in this case one of
    the major monuments of the Augustan era,” that is, the portico of
    the Danaids that was a part of Augustus’ temple of Apollo on the
    Palatine (cf. Prop. 2.31.3-4; Ov. *Tr*. 3.1.61). For further
    discussion of this monument and its meaning see also Zanker 1988,
    85-86, and Galinsky 1996, 220-222. It should also be noted – as
    Fowler 2000, 213, suggests – that the baldric also represents “an
    archetypal Roman *monumentum*, the spoils of war taken from the
    enemy and put on display, the sort of spoils that we now know Gallus
    predicted a Caesar – Julius or Augustus is uncertain – would put on
    display in the temples of Rome.”

[^361]: See Fowler 2000, 214: “Aeneas’ reaction to \[the baldric\] can
    also be generalized to make it an example of the use in general of
    *monumenta.* For Pallas, presumably, the monument meant one thing,
    for Turnus another: Aeneas then imposes on it his own reading, a
    reading which will be disastrous for Turnus.” See also Jaeger, 1990,
    177, arguing that “within the economy of the poem the baldric is a
    doubly forceful *monumentum*, since both Aeneas and Vergil’s
    audience share the memory it evokes.”

[^362]: Most 2001, 151, suggests that “Turnus loses his life to a memory
    which comes to life so as to avenge itself for its own death, to a
    memory which has forgotten that it is only a memory.” See also Henry
    1989, 19, where the scholar notes that “Virgil calls the belt of
    Pallas *saevi monimenta doloris*, ‘a reminder of bitter grief’; it
    is not the belt itself, but Aeneas’ memory of how the belt was
    taken, that brings doom to Turnus.”

[^363]: As Fowler 2000, 216-217, is right to suggest, “whatever the
    scene on the baldric or Turnus’ wearing of it was supposed to mean,
    what matters is what Aeneas does with it: the *monumenta* mean what
    the audience wants them to mean.”

[^364]: See Putnam 1994, Bartsch 1998, and Fowler 2000.

[^365]: Putnam 1994, 171-189, provides a close analysis of the myth and
    provides previous bibliography on the subject. For a more recent
    interpretation see also Harrison 2006, 174.

[^366]: See Fowler 2000, 213, arguing that “\[t\]he killing of Turnus is
    a reaction to *monumenta,* and a reminder again that meaning is
    determined by the reader: whatever Turnus wanted his monuments to
    say, to Aeneas they were a spur to the act of vengeance.”

[^367]: See Putnam 1994. Jaeger 1990, 203, also suggests that
    “\[t\]hrough the story of Pallas’ baldric Vergil stresses that a
    *monumentum* both reminds men of history and impels them to action,
    that memory takes on a life of its own.”

[^368]: See Bartsch 1998, 334, claiming that “\[t\]he baldric is thus
    doubly *saevi monimenta doloris*: its reminding function points both
    to Pallas’ death and to its own imagery, a reminder of another, far
    older moment of savagery. It is, in fact, a reminder *to* savagery.”

[^369]: That is not to say that Aeneas might not have good reasons to
    kill Turnus. Galinsky, 1996, 211, argues (with help from Servius)
    that “\[t\]he *Aeneid* ends with Aeneas’ killing of Turnus, a
    justified act of vengeance that has both a personal and a public
    dimension. As for the latter, it suffices to quote Servius again,
    who clearly saw (*ad Aen.* 12.949) that it was *ultio foederis
    rupti* – revenge for the breaking of the treaty, a violation of
    divine and human law for which there was no clemency in Rome. This
    public aspect is complemented by Aeneas’ private obligation (an act
    of *pietas,* as Servius noted) to avenge the death of Evander’s son
    Pallas who had been entrusted to him.” In fact, Galinsky connects
    the baldric-as*-monumenta* to the Temple of Mars Ultor, which he
    claims was similarly a “monument to both Augustus’ private and
    public revenge, respectively, on the murderers of his adoptive
    father and on the Parthians.”

[^370]: Eco 1979, 34, maintains that “\[t\]he end of the text is not its
    final state, since the reader is invited to make his own free
    choices and to reevaluate the entire text from the point of view of
    his final decision. Such a situation is typical of many avant-garde
    texts (fictional and nonfictional)...” The multiplicity of
    perspectives at the end of the poem here and the unresolved nature
    of the baldric’s and perhaps the poem’s meaning as *monumenta*
    suggests that the openness of the text is not a purely modern or
    “avant-garde” phenomenon. On this issue see also Roberts, Dunn, and
    Fowler 1997 for essays that tackle the different kinds of “closure”
    to be found in a variety of classical texts.

[^371]: See Hardie 1997, 142-151, on the difficulties presented by the
    ending of the *Aeneid*.

[^372]: See Putnam 1994, 189: “\[The end of the poem\] warns that, even
    as we advance idealistically toward Augustus’s putative golden age,
    human nature doesn’t change.”

[^373]: Bartsch 1998, 325-326, connects the permeability of the
    Baldric’s boundaries with those of the Trojan Horse and the
    labyrinth, which are both “breached,” leading to violent outcomes in
    both cases. “This paradoxical failure of art to contain,” according
    to Bartsch, “relies on the deception of the viewer (whether human or
    quadruped) in Virgil’s text and points to concerns inherent in
    ancient notions of the workings of art.”

[^374]: Fowler 1990, 56-58, argues that the allowance of multiple
    viewpoints – or “deviant focalization,” as he terms it – is an
    “ideological act...\[that\] challenges the Augustan order.” But see
    Bartsch 1998, 336, stressing that we should read the art in the poem
    “neither in the optimistic and perhaps claustrophobic Augustan view
    of art as a force to contain political unrest, nor in the idea that
    art both deceives and potentially infects its viewer with a
    propensity to violent imitation.”

[^375]: See Choay 2001, 6-7: “The affective nature of \[the monument’s\]
    purpose is essential; it is not simply a question of informing, of
    calling to mind a neutral bit of information, but rather of stirring
    up, through the emotions, a living memory. In this original meaning,
    one would term a monument any artifact erected by a community of
    individuals to commemorate or to recall for future generations
    individuals, events, sacrifices, practices or beliefs. The
    specificity of the monument is therefore a direct function of the
    way it acts on memory. Not only does it mobilize and engage memory
    through the mediation of affectivity, in such a way as to recall the
    past while bringing it to life as if it were present. But the past
    that is invoked and called forth, in an almost incantatory way, is
    not just any past: it is localized and selected to a critical end,
    to the degree that it is capable of directly contributing to the
    maintenance and preservation of the identity of an ethnic,
    religious, national, tribal or familial community.”

[^376]: Bartsch 1998, 338-339, concludes by claiming that “what Virgil
    is trying to do with the *Aeneid’*s reflections on the role of art
    in the political world is to banish the binary alternatives that
    ideology offers us, precisely by invoking the impossibility of
    dictating artistic interpretation even as Augustus begins his turn
    to an ideological artistic program at Rome. \[...\] What the
    thriving industry of the interpretation of the *Aeneid* demonstrates
    is the success of the artwork at producing differing and ambiguous
    interpretations, even those that undermine its overt message.”

[^377]: See Quint 1982, 38, arguing that “\[c\]ontradictions within
    Augustan propaganda and policy may underlie the *Aeneid’*s
    alternative, apparently irreconcilable viewpoints: its hope in a new
    national future, its dread that Roman history cannot escape from a
    destructive repetition compulsion. But perhaps Virgil realized that
    his poem, by contributing to an official program of historical
    revision and mythification, might produce the very effect it sought
    to avoid. By forgetting its past, Virgil’s Rome is condemned to
    repeat it.”

[^378]: Harrison 2006, 183. Harrison’s general argument is that “the
    filtering of politically charged monuments through indirect literary
    allusion, analogous to the filtering and modification of other
    literary texts, allows (as in the *Aeneid* generally) more complex,
    nuanced, and humane views on the tragic aspects of heroic
    achievement to have a place alongside undoubted complements to the
    striking reconstruction of Rome under Augustus.”

[^379]: Fowler 2000, 217, rightly sees the efficacy of *monumenta* as
    “simultaneously hopeless and necessary: hopeless, because the belief
    that there can be anything between desire and memory that we can
    talk about in language is just another example of our deluded
    pursuit of the lost presence of the imaginary, necessary because
    without desire there can be no beginning at all, no setting out on
    the journey.”

[^380]: See pp. 79-89 above.

[^381]: Cooley 2009, 158, *ad loc*., notes that the “implicit claim”
    that Augustus’ birth marked a new age for Rome is “captured exactly
    by use of the word αἰών in the Greek version \[of the inscription\],
    rather than χρόνος.”

[^382]: Brunt and Moore 1967 \[1981\], 54-55, *ad loc*., provide a brief
    survey of the possible dates of these three closures over which
    there has been some scholarly debate. See also Cooley 2009, 159-160,
    *ad loc*., for further discussion of the debate, with bibliography.

[^383]: There is a tremendous amount of scholarship devoted to
    difficulties of interpreting the Ara Pacis. See Zanker 1988,
    126-130, where it is suggested that the monument’s “\[l\]ack of
    narrative and an intellectualized symbolism lend classicistic
    imagery a remarkable ‘openness’ of interpretation,” and Galinsky
    1996, 141-169, esp. 149, similarly suggesting that there is an
    “intentional multiplicity of meanings” in the monument. See also
    Mayer 2010, 119-120, n. 17, for further bibliography.

[^384]: Armstrong 2009, 82, even suggests that “Daedalus’ temple for
    Apollo acts (at least on some levels) as a prefiguration of
    Augustus’ temple of Apollo on the Palatine, dedicated after escape
    at a price, as Augustus’ was dedicated after Actium and the terrible
    losses of the civil war.”

[^385]: See Galinsky 1996, 221, where the scholar argues from his
    reading of the Danaid portico among other monuments that “\[t\]he
    evidence suggests that from the beginning of his reign, Augustus and
    the artists working with him were intent on developing an imagery
    that involved experimentation and multiple meanings.”

[^386]: Augustus apparently included in his forum Apelles’ famous
    representation of *Furor* bound and sitting atop weapons – just as
    Vergil portrays him in Book 1. Cf. Servius Danielis’ note on *Aen*.
    1.294, as well as Pliny *HN*. 35.27, 93-94, as cited in Harrison
    2006, 181-182, who sees the installation of Apelles’ work in the
    Forum of Augustus as not only Augustan but also occurring possibly
    in the late 20s BCE while the *Aeneid* was being composed. The
    argument I am makin here (unlike Harrison’s) is not dependent on
    whether such a work was a part of the Forum before or after the
    completion of the epic poem: Vergil is not so much discussing
    individual works of architectural detail as the very idea of what
    architectural monuments can and cannot do.

[^387]: Galinsky 1996, 222, argues that “Augustan culture was
    characterized not by frigid homogeneity, but by the existence of
    plentiful tensions and contradictions, the monarchic republic or
    republican monarchy being the prime example. \[...\] Instead of
    simple and obvious ‘messages,’ Augustan art (and poetry) asks for
    the intellectual participation of the viewer or reader and for their
    scrutiny of alternative interpretations in order that the intentions
    of the creators may be understood all the more thoroughly.”

[^388]: Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 23. According to the two of them, in
    fact, “\[t\]he shifting positions of spectatorship, the experience
    of ‘double vision’ and the phenomenon of the visual palimpsest all
    feature prominently, amid a general interest in lack of closure and
    the contestation of meaning in this most remarkable of urban, public
    spaces,” that is, the city Rome (9). See also Welch 2005, 23,
    suggesting that for the Romans of the Augustan age “\[t\]he presence
    of Romes divergent over time thus multiplies the ways one may
    interpret Roman monuments.”

[^389]: On Propertius’ take on the idea of the monument see Welch 2005,
    19-34, where she claims that “\[t\]he multiple perspectives on
    Rome’s places offered in elegy 4.1 raise the possibility that Rome’s
    monuments are not monolithic in their meaning, but rather mean
    different things to different people or to the same people at
    different times or in different contexts” (34). For the way that
    Livy uses monuments in his history see Jaeger 1997, *passim*, and
    esp. 11-12: “When monuments fail and the text restores them,
    reminders of stories give way to stories about reminders. By drawing
    attention to the \[Livy’s\] reconstructive activity, the restored
    monuments \[in the *Ab urbe condita*\] commemorate his recollection
    of that past.” I discuss in more detail Livy’s “monumental” history,
    as well as Jaeger’s arguments about it, in Chapter II above (pp.
    36-43).

[^390]: For further discussion of this anxiety see pp. 193-196 below.

[^391]: The idea of memory itself – like the idea of the monument –
    cannot exist without the possibility of its failure, i.e., that one
    can forget. See Most 2001, 149, where he proposes that Vergil “not
    only knew that human memory is constantly besieged by oblivion and
    that every effort of memory must struggle against the insistence of
    forgetfulness; he also recognized that memory even presupposes
    forgetting and depends upon it.”

[^392]: Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 55-56, suggest that a balanaced
    perspective such as this was an essential ingredient to the success
    of the Augustan age to rise out of the chaos of Rome’s recent past,
    since “the civil wars of the first century BCE and a material
    decline in the fabric of Rome could be represented as integral to a
    period of optimistic transformation and restoration under Augustus.”
