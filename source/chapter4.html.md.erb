Horace is not the only or the first Augustan poet to predict his
“immortality” – or to do so by imagining his poetry as a monumental
edifice. Vergil had already done as much in the celebrated proem that
begins the second half of his *Georgics*, as the below excerpt from Book
3 of the poem demonstrates:

> ...temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
> tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
> primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,          
> Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas;
> primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
> et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
> propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
> Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.
> in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit (*G*. 3.8-16)[^233]
>
> I must attempt a path by which I too might be able to lift myself from
> the ground and fly victorious through the mouths of men. I returning
> to my native land shall be the first – provided that I live long
> enough – to lead back with me the Muses from the Aonian peak; I shall
> be the first to carry back the Idumean palms to you, Mantua, and I
> will establish a temple of marble in a green field near the water,
> where the great Mincius wanders, slowly curving, and covers its banks
> with tender reeds. In the middle of my temple will be Caesar, and he
> will possess it.

It is clear from the first two lines of this passage (cf.
*temptanda*...*ora*, 8-9) that Vergil too is speaking of achieving
immortality through his poetry.[^234] And like Horace he uses the image
of a monumental structure to stake his claim to it. “I will establish a
temple of marble” (*templum de marmore ponam*, 13), the Mantuan poet
proclaims to his readers, a temple to Augustus Caesar (cf. *in*
*medio...Caesar erit templumque tenebit*, 16). There is one significant
and obvious difference, of course, between the respective poetic
statements of these two poets: Horace has already built his monument
(*exegi monumentum*..., *C*. 3.30.1) when he announces his claim to
immortality while Vergil has yet to erect his “epic” temple, using only
future verbs (*ponam*, 13; *tenebit*, 16) throughout the description of
the building.

Although it is not hard to understand why this monumental temple has
been read as a metaphor for what the *Aeneid* would become,[^235] the
goal of this chapter and the next one is not to decide whether or not
this particular structure should be seen as somehow representative of
the exact epic poem that Vergil would end up writing. Nor will I undergo
an extensive analysis of the very complex images of this proem from the
*Georgics*.[^236] I briefly mention Vergil’s temple here at the start
only to point out two important elements for a study of his architexture
in the *Aeneid*. First, this passage demonstrates explicitly that the
poet employs the imagery of architecture – and in particular monumental,
public architecture – in order to give concrete form to his poetics.
Epic for Vergil is represented here as a grand, seemingly stable
structure “of marble” (*de marmore*, 13) in an idyllic, peaceful setting
(13-14). The proem to *Georgics* 3 is thus significant for establishing
monumental architecture as an operative metaphor for Vergil’s epic
poetry, especially since he is not nearly so explicit in the *Aeneid* as
Horace is in his *Odes* when the latter states that his poem is a
*monumentum*. Second, whereas Horace speaks only of his monument’s
impenetrable exterior and its apparently impervious nature,[^237] the
poet of the *Georgics* lets us see inside his temple, right to the
statue of Augustus Caesar at its center. And it is this focus on what
lies behind the surface of structures that marks a notable difference in
Vergil’s own architexture when it comes to his epic.[^238] The
*princeps* might possess the temple here in the *Georgics* in a way that
gives stability to the building’s meaning through his “numinous power”
in contrast to the allusive depictions of civil war on the exterior of
its doors.[^239] In the *Aeneid*, however, the interiors of many of the
poem’s structures are much darker, I argue, and filled with forces that
seek to destabilize order rather than impose it. One of the main
architextural images of the poem – the Temple of Janus (*Aen*.
1.293-296) – is possessed not by an Augustus, in fact, but rather by the
*furor impius* of Rome’s past which while temporarily bound seems eager
to break free at any moment.

The previous chapter examined how Horace constructs generic boundaries
that while purporting to keep out extrageneric space and time actually
incorporate them within his traditional lyric dimensions. This way of
constructing a dynamic and innovative kind of lyric monument through
what I have termed an inverted *recusatio* was shown to parallel the
kind of rhetoric that Augustus also employs in his *Res Gestae* when
speaking of his architectural productions in the Roman cityscape. In
both cases, I argued, the structures created are not as traditional as
they might first appear; they become enhanced rather by their ability to
take on the meaning that they claim to exclude through rhetorical
disavowals. These structures – whether poetic, political, or real – thus
achieve a dual nature of being old and new simultaneously, with a
delicate but perfect balancing of tensions between those two extremes.

The analysis of the *Aeneid* in this dissertation will examine the way
that Vergil takes the architexture of Horace’s *monumentum* and flips
our perspective: the epic poet looks not at the extrageneric forces that
Horace balances against his lyric traditional structure to enhance its
stability, but rather at the chaos from Rome’s past that threatens the
stability of his epic poem *qua* “monument” from *within* its
structure.[^240] The ability of a monument to hide something disruptive
rather than simply keep out what is inappropriate thus sets the stage
for a much different understanding of monuments and generic boundaries
than the one arrived at for Horace’s *Odes*. Can the *Aeneid* with its
epic facade provide a stable frame for a teleological narrative from
Aeneas to Augustus?[^241] Can it successfully conceal beneath its
magnificent surface the chaotic violence of Rome’s past from its very
origins to Vergil’s present? And what does the poem’s success or failure
in these regards tell us about the idea of the monument in the Augustan
age? Those are the primary questions that will be asked in this chapter,
as well as the next one.

My concern will therefore not be to analyze the idea of the city in the
poem as a “poetological metaphor” for the text.[^242] Nor will I focus
on the allusions to actual Augustan monuments, as has been the custom of
many examinations of the poem when discussing architecture’s place in
it.[^243] I am not attempting, moreover, to analyze closely how the poem
helps us to understand better the visual aesthetics of actual Roman
architectural monuments.[^244] What I aim to do is to explore how the
poem engages with the monumental discourse of Augustan Rome – not only
employing it to articulate what an epic monument like the *Aeneid* can
and cannot do, but at the same time also exploring the strengths and
weaknesses of the discourse itself in relation to Rome’s past, present,
and future.[^245]

The discussion of the poem along these lines will be divided across two
chapters due to the vast amount of material in the *Aeneid* that could
be analyzed for these purposes. I will leave aside the poem’s named
*monumenta* for Chapter V in order to provide a context for them first
by focusing in this present chapter on the poem’s recurring theme of
“failed” architecture. I use the term “failed” architecture here to
refer to edifices that ultimately do not contain the chaos of the past
that they were built to conceal, but rather release it when their
boundaries become compromised, whether literally or
metaphorically.[^246] These constructions consist most notably of
certain caves and labyrinths in the poem, examined below in Part 1 and
Part 2, respectively. The former of this pair comprises not “natural”
caves, one should note, but *moles* – unnatural, constructed objects
that are erected to contain the chaos which the *Aeneid* reveals to be a
central part of Roman history from the start. These include Aeolus’ Cave
in Book 1, the Trojan Horse in Book 2 (which is also described several
times as a “cave”), and the Cave of Cacus in Book 8. With an examination
of the labyrinths in Books 5 and 6 of the poem I will transition in Part
2 to structures whose failure to restrain the chaotic forces of the past
occurs at a less literal level: the walls of the labyrinths are not
broken, *per se*, but are revealed to be always shifting and thus unable
to contain within themselves the past disorders and mistakes (*errores*)
they were designed to keep hidden. The point of this chapter will
therefore be to illustrate how such structures fail to maintain not just
their physical boundaries, but in the case of labyrinths often their
“epistemological” boundaries, as well, since what they appear to mean on
the outside is shown to be just as susceptible to collapse as their
material structure.[^247]

Before we begin to look at these “failed” structures, however, let us
briefly return to where this chapter began. The immense scholarly
attention given to the passage from the *Georgics* quoted at the start
of this chapter points to something else which it is important to keep
in mind during the following examination of Vergil’s architexture:
whatever the poet might have meant his temple to signify at the time
that he wrote the proem, it has not stopped future scholars from
bestowing their own interpretations on it – and thus transforming the
meaning of the structure into anything from an “abandoned project” to
the *Aeneid* itself.[^248] The present chapter and the following one
will explore how the architexture of the *Aeneid* illustrates that such
an instability of meaning is not only inherent to monumentality, as was
suggested above in Chapter II;[^249] more importantly, the poem
demonstrates the need for one always to be aware of this instability
when “reading” *monumenta* – whether poetic ones, such as the *Aeneid*,
or real ones in Rome’s physical landscape, such as the Temple of Janus.

###Part 1. The Constructed Caves of the *Aeneid*###

A cave is normally a natural “place” with firm boundaries that separate
inside from outside,[^250] distinguish light from dark,[^251] and can
even house primordial forces that defy rationalization and
structure.[^252] For the Romans, however, caves could be constructed, as
well, and in a way that blurred those seemingly rigid boundaries.[^253]
In the case of decorated grottoes, for instance, aristocrats and
emperors could enjoy nature in safety and under their control as part of
their domain – thus breaking down the distinction between the natural
and the artificial.[^254] In their poetry, moreover, Roman authors used
caves in a similar way to destabilize the boundaries of what is crafted
and what is untouched by human beings. In Vergil’s bucolic poems, for
example, Frederick Jones has recently shown how caves are one of the
“various apparently natural features in the *Eclogues* \[that\] turn out
not to be unequivocally natural”; according to Jones, in fact, caves
play an important role as an “element of bucolic iconography,”
representing an ideal space for bucolic song that is at once natural and
artificial.[^255]

The caves in the *Aeneid* examined below are not entirely natural,
either. They are constructions – *moles* – imposed upon nature to
contain the destructive, chaotic forces of the past that seek to escape
and upset the established order of things.[^256] It is the way that
these caves *fail* to keep such forces at bay, however, that makes them
relevant to a discussion of Vergilian architexture. It is not merely
that they become a marked space for epic song; they help rather to
illustrate what happens when someone – whether a god, an emperor, or a
poet – attempts to impose a structure upon the chaotic forces of the
past that exist as part of Rome’s history from its very origins. The
role of caves in the *Aeneid* is thus two-fold: they are simultaneously
architectural in the way they try to restrain the violence of the past
and *anti*-architectural in the sense that their own failure to do so
illustrates the very fragility of such restraints.[^257]

####(i) Aeolus’ Cave####

When readers (ancient or modern) come to Aeolus’ Cave in Book I of the
*Aeneid* they might have certain expectations based on the passage in
Homer’s *Odyssey* where Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag full of winds in
order to make his journey back home a little easier. Those expectations
are quickly disappointed, however.[^258] And the dramatic changes which
Vergil makes to his Homeric model provide a useful starting point for an
examination of an architectural feature in the form of constructed caves
that appears again and again in his epic poem.

Let us start by comparing the two structures that Aeolus inhabits in
each poem. Below is a short excerpt from Homer that describes Aeolus’
domain and activities in the *Odyssey*:

> We reached the island of Aeolia. There lived
> Aeolus Hippotades, dear to gods immortal,
> on a floating island, a wall of unbreakable bronze
> all around it, and the smooth rock ran sheer up.
> His twelve children were also in the palace,
>
> [...]
>
> They always dine beside their dear father and devoted mother.
> Countless good things lie beside them, and the house,
> steaming with sacrifice, echoes around the courtyard 10
> by day, and at night they sleep again beside their venerable wives
> in blankets and in corded beds.[^259]

Homer’s Aeolus lives in a palace (ἐνὶ μεγάροις, 5) with his twelve
children – a place of constant feasting and merriment where Odysseus and
his comrades spend a month enjoying the king’s hospitality while telling
of their journey thus far. The “wall of unbreakable bronze” (τεῖχος
χάλκεον ἄρρηκτον, 3) and “sheer” rock cliffs (cf. λισσὴ...πέτρη, 4) that
surround Aeolus’ kingdom are clearly intended to be barriers to keep
others out of this small piece of paradise.[^260] Vergil gives us a
rather different picture of Aeolus’ “kingdom” when he narrates Juno’s
visit there early in Book 1 of the *Aeneid*:

> Talia flammato secum dea corde uolutans
> nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus Austris,
> Aeoliam uenit. hic uasto rex Aeolus antro
> luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras
> imperio premit ac uinclis et carcere frenat.
> illi indignantes magna cum murmure montis
> circum claustra fremunt. (Verg. *Aen*. 1.50-56)
>
> Debating such things with herself in her inflamed heart the goddess
> arrived at Aeolia, the land of the storm-clouds, places filled with
> raging southwest winds. Here in a vast cave Aeolus as king keeps in
> check the winds struggling to break free and the boisterous storms,
> and restrains them in chains and a prison. They angrily roar at their
> bonds as the mountain rumbles loudly.

Aeolus’ country is certainly no island paradise in the *Aeneid*, but
instead is a place “filled with raging southwest winds” (*feta
furentibus Austris*, 51). His home is still immense – but only a cave
(*uasto...antro*, 52).[^261] Aeolus’ companions are not his family,
moreover, but “winds struggling to break free and boisterous storms”
(*luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras*, 53), which he must keep
under control in a sort of “prison” (*carcere*, 54). And even then these
unwilling inhabitants continue to roar at the constraints that bind them
(*indignantes...circum claustra fremunt*, 55-56). This island prison is
certainly not the impression one gets from Aeolus’ palace in the
*Odyssey*.

I will return to examine more fully the nature of the architecture in
this passage below. It is important, however, to consider beforehand
also the charge that is given to Aeolus in both poems. First, from
Homer:

> Aeolus gave Odysseus a leather bag, of a nine year-old ox he’d
> skinned, and bound the ways of the blustering winds in it
> for Cronion had made him master of the winds,
> both to start and stop the ones he wishes.[^262]

All Aeolus has to do in the *Odyssey* apparently is put the winds in a
bag – and everything is suddenly calm for Odysseus to go on his way. He
is not the jailor of the winds as Aeolus is in the *Aeneid*; on the
contrary, he simply controls them according to his fancy (cf. ὅν κ’
ἐθέλῃσι, 22). Homer’s Aeolus is thus “an authoritarian figure who
exercises absolute and peremptory judgment.”[^263] This could not be
further from the nature of Aeolus’ task in Vergil’s poem, as the
following passage demonstrates:

> ...celsa sedet Aeolus arce
> sceptra tenens mollitque animas et temperat iras.
> ni faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum
> quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per auras;
> sed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris
> hoc metuens molemque et montis insuper altos
> imposuit, regemque dedit qui foedere certo
> et premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas. (*Aen*. 1.56-63)
>
> Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, as he both
> softens their spirits and checks their wraths. If he should not do
> this, they would no doubt carry away the seas and the lands and the
> vast sky in no time and sweep it all with them through the breezes.
> But fearing this would happen the all-powerful father hid them in dark
> caverns, placing a *moles* and high mountains above, and he gave them
> a king who under a fixed agreement would know how to restrain them and
> – when given the order – to loosen the reins.

It is Aeolus’ job to make sure that he “checks the wraths” of the winds
(*temperat iras*, 57); for if he should not, they would “sweep away”
(*uerrant*, 59) everything – sea, land, sky – in their uncontrollable
rage. Jupiter realizing this (in fact, “fearing this,” *hoc metuens*,
61) built Aeolus’ Cave to ensure that there could be order in the
cosmos. He then made Aeolus the “king” (*regem*, 62) of the winds. This
charge is given to Aeolus not so that he can use them as he pleases, as
he does in Homer; it is “under a fixed agreement” (*foedere certo*, 62)
here that Aeolus is said to control the winds “when given the order”
(*iussus*, 63), presumably, by Jupiter himself. This is not then a
simple matter of putting the winds in a bag. The cosmic significance of
Aeolus’ charge in the *Aeneid* signals a need for a different kind of
architecture – one not simply for display, or one that is intended to
keep things out, but rather one which would contain, or “hide” (cf.
*abdidit*, 60), that which would upset the established order of
Jupiter.[^264]

But why speak of this cave as architectural? Aeolus’ palace in the
*Aeneid* is a “vast cave” (cf. *vasto*...*antro*, 52; *speluncis*, 60),
after all. It is important to note, though, that it is also an
*artificial* cave constructed by Jupiter himself: *molemque et montis
insuper altos* / *imposuit* (61-62). In other words, this mountain is
not natural, *per se*, but *imposed* upon nature by the king of the
gods. The artificiality of this “mountain” is emphasized, moreover, by
the poet’s identification of it as a *moles*, that is, a large, usually
man-made structure often built as a means to create land over a body of
water.[^265] At the same time, however, this is no ordinary *moles* that
functions merely as a dam or as a means to extend the land into the
sea.[^266] The structure is meant rather to contain the chaos that
apparently used to run rampant in a time before any order. One could
even say that Aeolus’ Cave is the very *first* structure in the sense
that it necessarily precedes all others: if the Aeolus should not
restrain the winds in this *moles*, the poet warns, “they would no doubt
carry away the seas and the lands and the vast sky in no time and sweep
it all with them through the breezes” (*ni faciat, maria ac terras
caelumque profundum* / *quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per
auras*, 1.58-59). Nothing could stand for very long, in other words,
without this massive structure to keep the winds in check. It is
possible, therefore, to see a double meaning in Aeolus’ statement to
Juno that gods have made him *tempestatum*... *potentem* (1.80), namely,
that he is not only “powerful over the storms,” but over “time”
itself,[^267] since there would be nothing – no structures, no monuments
– to mark the passage of time if the winds were to roam free as
previously in what could only be an eternal chaos.[^268] It is
architecture, then, which the *Aeneid* suggests as the very craft which
gives structure not only to space but even to time against the chaos
which seems to be a constant in the story of Rome from the start.[^269]

It makes a certain amount of sense that the first building to appear in
Vergil’s narrative would also be the primordial edifice of his epic
cosmos.[^270] With such significance, however, it is important to note
again that there is something quite unnatural about this *moles*. Aeolus
must subdue the winds struggling to break free (*luctantis uentos*, 53)
with his “power” (*imperio*, 54) and – even more unnatural – he must do
so by “restrain[ing] them in chains and a prison” (*uinclis et carcere
frenat*, 54) that his cave represents. Indeed, these winds are further
described as *indignantes* at their imprisonment,[^271] as they “roar at
their locks” (*circum claustra fremunt*, 56). This imposition of a
structure upon a clearly unwilling element of nature is thus both
explicitly highlighted and rather extreme – especially when compared,
for instance, to the mere “bag” that Aeolus uses to hold the winds in
the *Odyssey*. The fact that the next part of the line after the caesura
calls Aeolus’ residence a lofty citadel (*celsa*...*arce*, 56) further
illustrates that this is certainly not as natural a cave as it might
have appeared at first.[^272]

The above analysis of this primeval edifice thus far has highlighted two
important points about the place of architecture in Vergil’s *Aeneid*:
\[1\] nature in the poem is filled with chaotic and violent forces and
\[2\] the structures that try to impose order upon them are not accepted
willingly by those forces. What is even more significant perhaps for
this present study is the fact that this “first” structure eventually
fails – even if only temporarily – to contain those forces: Aeolus is
easily bribed by Juno to set free the winds and cracks open the *moles*
imposed upon them in order to give them a breach from which to
depart.[^273] This failure is particularly noteworthy because it means
that even a structure built by the “all-mighty” (*omnipotens*, 60)
Jupiter cannot keep these forces in check permanently.

It is not simply “violence suppressed and then coming to the surface”
that is the “all-encompassing motif” of this opening scene,[^274] but a
much more primordial kind of chaos from the deep past that must be
overcome for order to exist at all. Such cosmic order is quickly
regained, of course, when Neptune emerges from the sea to chastise the
winds.[^275] Yet the fact that the “first” building in the poem fails to
accomplish the purpose for which it was built – if only for a short
while – should make readers somewhat suspicious from the start of
architecture’s ability to maintain the stability of its imposition on
these buried chaotic forces of the past. The below examination of other
caves in the poem will show that the failure of such structures to hold
in check these forces is in fact a common theme throughout the epic.

Before I turn to those other failed structures, however, it is essential
at this point to introduce another edifice in Book 1 that I will return
to several times in my analysis of the epic’s architexture. After
discussing in very general terms the history of Rome for the sake of the
distressed Venus, whose son Aeneas has been tossed about on the sea by
Aeolus’ storms, the father of the gods goes into great detail to depict
what lurks inside of the Temple of Janus in Vergil’s own day:

> ...dirae ferro et compagibus artis
> claudentur Belli portae; Furor impius intus
> saeua sedens super arma et centum uinctus aenis
> post tergum nodis fremet horridus ore cruento. (*Aen*. 1.293-296)
>
> Those terrible gates of War will be closed with tight, iron bounds.
> Seated within upon cruel weapons and bound by a hundred bronze knots
> behind his back impious *Furor* will give a terrifying roar from his
> mouth stained with blood.

The imagery in this passage is remarkably similar in several respects to
features of Aeolus’ Cave examined above.[^276] The Temple of Janus is
also presented as a sort of prison that has been bolted shut (*ferro et
compagibus artis* / *claudentur*, 293-294). Just like the winds,
moreover, the main prisoner – the personified *Furor* – is bound with
chains: his hands have been tied behind his back by a thousand brazen
knots (cf. *centum uinctus aenis* / *post tergum nodis*, 295-296).
Finally, the main verb, *fremet* (“roars,” 296), almost cannot but
remind a reader of the winds who also are said to *fremunt* at their own
bonds (*circum claustra* *fremunt*, 56) not too much earlier in Book 1.
There is no Augustus at the core of this temple as in the proem of
*Georgics* 3. The space in the *Aeneid* is occupied instead by a
personification of disorder itself that though chained is definitely not
a willing prisoner.

In both of these scenes, then, the depiction of architecture represents
it as a means of containing (or even hiding) a violent, chaotic force
from the past that threatens to break down established structures and
general order. Given the proximity in the poem of these two buildings at
the very start of the epic, however, it does not seem inappropriate to
question the ability of the temple to continue to keep such a force in
check. If a cavernous *moles* built by Jupiter himself fails to contain
this chaos permanently, who is to say that the Temple of Janus might not
one day crack, as well? Rome might be an *imperium* *sine fine* (“an
empire without boundary,” *Aen*. 1.279) when it comes to its ability to
expand without limit. There *are* boundaries that exist within it,
though, at its very center and which contain a force – civil strife –
perhaps even more destructive than anything at its outer borders, as any
Roman living through the decades of civil war in the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
could attest. In short, the *Aeneid* from the start configures the story
of Rome as a constant struggle to contain a violent chaos that seeks to
breakdown any order imposed upon it – from Aeolus’ Cave at the very
start of time all the way to the Temple of Janus in the Augustan age
itself.

The first 300 lines of the *Aeneid* present a much different
understanding of architecture than what is found in Horace’s *Odes*
where his *monumentum* of a poem was able to resist indefinitely the
storms of time that wear down all human achievement.[^277] In the
*Aeneid*, on the other hand, it is the chaos *within* the structure that
is the point of interest. Aeolus’ Cave sets the stage from the very
start of the poem for a particular kind of architextural boundary that
does not help one to expand what one has so much as to enclose within
that which would threaten the stability of everything that one has
established. The failure of this kind of architecture to contain such
forces repeats throughout the *Aeneid* in other “caves,” as well as in
the poem’s labyrinths, and should alert the reader to the fragile nature
of the more triumphant kind of architecture that the poem presents in
the form of *monumenta*, particularly in Book 8. As the next chapter
will demonstrate, in fact, the architexture of Vergil’s *Aeneid* finds a
place between these two kinds of architecture: it is at once a
monumental facade that makes a claim to a specific, glorious meaning
*and* a “failed” monument that shows the cracks in its magnificent epic
frame, revealing the chaos of the past lurking behind it.

####(ii) The Trojan Horse####

Although the Cave of Aeolus was built by Jupiter, it ultimately fails to
contain permanently the chaotic forces of the deep past that threaten
the order he has established on a cosmic level. Failed attempts to
contain such forces also occur on a smaller scale in the poem, as can be
witnessed, for instance, in the case of the Trojan Horse. This section
will show that the various descriptions in Book 2 of the Trojan Horse –
another unnatural *moles*[^278] – bear a striking resemblance to the way
that the poet described Aeolus’ Cave analyzed above. There are certain
differences between the two structures, however, and analyzing these
will help to flesh out additional important aspects of “failed”
architecture in the *Aeneid*, especially from the perspective of those
who see only the present surface and are unmindful of the past chaos
within.

Let us start where Aeneas himself begins his narrative of the fall of
Troy at the beginning of Book 2:

> ...fracti bello fatisque repulsi
> ductores Danaum, tot iam labentibus annis,
> instar montis equum diuina Palladis arte
> aedificant sectaque intexunt abiete costas;
> uotum pro reditu simulant: ea fama uagatur.
> huc delecta uirum sortiti corpora furtim
> includunt caeco lateri penitusque cauernas
> ingentis uterumque armato milite complent. (*Aen*. 2.13-20)
>
> When the commanders of the Greeks were broken by war and driven back
> by fates – so many years having slipped by already – they build a
> horse the equivalent of a mountain with the divine craft of Pallas
> Athena and weave its ribs from the chopped-up wood \[of their ships\].
> They pretend that it is an offering for their safe return: this is the
> rumor that spreads. Secretly they enclose the bodies of men selected
> by lot there in its dark flank, within its vast caverns, filling its
> womb with an armed band of soldiers.

With nothing else left to try the Greek leaders turn to trickery in
order to take the city of Troy. What is immediately noteworthy about
this passage is the tension between natural and artificial – a
characteristic already noted above in the description of Aeolus’ Cave in
Book 1. First of all, one usually does not “build a horse”
(*equum*...*aedificant*, 15-16), or use pieces of ships to “weave ribs”
(*intexunt*...*costas*, 16).[^279] There is again something unnatural
about this construction for the Greeks who are doing it all with the
help of another god, that is, “with the divine craft of Pallas Athena”
(*divina Palladis arte*, 15).[^280] And it is not just that they are
building a horse; more than that, they are raising it to be “the
equivalent of a mountain” (*instar montis*, 15), rivaling the natural
with their artificial construction. The Horse is not merely as big as a
mountain, though. Just as with the *moles* that Jupiter constructs to
house the winds the Trojan Horse is also said to contain a violent force
“within its vast caverns” (*penitus*...*cavernas* / *ingentis*,
19-20),[^281] namely, the Greeks who “fill its womb with an armed band
of soldiers” (*uterumque armato milite complent*, 20).[^282] This idea
that the Greeks have somehow “impregnated” the Horse calls to mind the
very first detail the reader learns about Aeolus’ land: it too is
“pregnant with winds” (cf. *feta uentis*, *Aen*. 1.51) – furious winds
that Jupiter has implanted within his artificial construction. The
Greeks not only “build” (*aedificant*, 16) a horse, then, but construct
it as a *moles* to rival even a mountain together with the dark caves it
might contain. Both of these ideas suggest an overstepping of what is
natural for one to construct. But the poet goes a step further by
implying that the Greeks even impregnate it (cf. *uterumque*...
*complent*, 20), too, with men ready to destroy the city of Troy.[^283]
The poet makes it explicit in several way therefore that the Trojan
Horse from its very first description is represented like Aeolus’ Cave
as an artificial construction that contains violent, destructive forces
of the past which seek to destroy all order – in this case, the Greeks
with their desire to overturn the order of Trojan life and the city that
contains it.

It is not just the similarity to the description of Aeolus’ Cave that
brings the Trojan Horse in dialogue with the chaotic scene from Book 1
examined in the previous section; more importantly, the ultimate
“failure” of the Trojan Horse to contain its own chaotic forces likewise
calls to mind the unleashing of the winds by Aeolus. When the Greeks
slip out of the Horse at night they too introduce a chaotic force that
will end up destroying all order and bringing about the city’s literal
downfall.[^284] The close connection between these two destructive,
chaotic forces – the winds of Aeolus and the Greeks in the Horse – is in
fact anticipated by the language which the poet uses at the very start
of this process. When Aeneas awakes from his dream featuring Hector’s
ghost, the Trojan hero goes outside and describes the chaos he beholds
with the following simile:

> in segetem ueluti cum flamma **furentibus Austris**
> incidit, aut rapidus montano flumine torrens
> sternit agros, sternit sata laeta boumque labores
> praecipitesque trahit siluas… (*Aen*. 2.304-307)
>
> Just as when fire falls upon the grain field **with raging southwest
> winds**, or the swift torrent from a mountain river covers the fields,
> covers the bountiful harvests, and drags along with it the toils of
> bulls and falling trees.

The most pertinent part of this frightening simile is the end of the
first line: “with raging southwest winds” (*furentibus Austris*, 304).
The only other time that Vergil uses this particular phrase – and in the
exact same position in the meter no less – is when the poet describes
Aeolus’ Cave examined above, where the king’s land is also said to be
filled with *furentibus Austris* (1.51).[^285] It is not a coincidence
that the men who come from the horse are compared to the furious winds
so precisely: the poet is foreshadowing through this simile the parallel
nature of these forces of violence from the past that break free of
their bounds to wreak havoc on the established order of things – whether
it be in the middle of the sea, or inside the stable, long-standing city
of Troy.

There are also two important differences, however, between Aeolus’s Cave
and the Trojan Horse that complicate the theme of “failed” architecture
in the *Aeneid*. First, the primary purpose for the construction of the
former structure is to prevent the chaos it is holding from destroying
all order – something the *moles* fails to accomplish temporarily at
least when Aeolus releases the winds. In the case of the Horse, however,
there are different motivations for such a construction: the Greeks
build it in order to hold a destructive force that will eventually
destroy the solid citadel of Troy when unleashed. In other words, the
monumental horse is a case of an intentionally failed piece of
architecture, that is, an edifice designed to “crack” and release the
chaos from the past that it contains.

This does not mean, though, that the purpose of the Horse is apparent to
all. And the ambiguity of its meaning suggests a second important
difference between the two artificial *moles*. Aeolus’ Cave seems to be
far away from the realm of mortals in the middle of the sea; its
external appearance – be it an immense mountain – is not too important.
The Trojan Horse is an explicitly monumental structure, on the other
hand, one meant to elicit the awe of those who see it. The purpose of
its construction is to create a facade that allows the structure to
express another meaning than the one for which it was actually built. It
will be easiest perhaps to see this ambiguity of meaning which exists
between what one sees on the surface and what lies beneath by examining
the different ways that the Trojan priest Laocoon and the Greek
“runaway” Sinon craft their respective arguments regarding the Horse’s
meaning, as well as the relative success of each.

The priest of Neptune makes several remarks that encourage his fellow
Trojans to look past the magnificent exterior of the Horse:

> ..."o miseri, quae tanta insania, ciues?
> creditis auectos hostis? aut ulla putatis
> dona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Vlixes?
> aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achiui,
> aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros
> inspectura domos uenturaque desuper urbi,
> aut aliquis latet error: equo ne credite, Teucri.
> quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis." (*Aen*. 2.42-49)
>
> "My misfortunate fellow citizens, what so great madness is this? Do
> you believe the enemy has sailed away? Or do you think that any gifts
> of the Greeks are without tricks? Is that the Ulysses we know? Either
> the Achaeans are hidden closed within this wood, or this war-machine
> has been constructed against our walls so that it can inspect our
> homes and come into our city from above, or some *error* lies hidden:
> do not believe in this horse, Trojans. Whatever it is, I fear even
> Greeks bearing gifts."

For Laocoon, at least, this structure is no doubt hiding Greek “tricks”
(*dolis Danaum*, 44) and/or Greeks themselves (cf. *occultantur Achiui*,
45). It is a structure, moreover, that Laoccon claims has been
“constructed against \[Troy’s\] walls” (*in…fabricata est*...*muros*,
46): it will not only look over the city, but the very homes (*domos*,
47) of its inhabitants – bypassing the distinction between private and
public in the urban realm. What it contains Laocoon himself does not
know (*quidquid id est*, 49) – only that some *error*, some devious,
unexpected outcome lies hidden (*aliquis latet error*, 48).[^286] This
is no ordinary “horse.” And the priest is right to urge his citizens not
to put their faith in it (*equo ne credite, Teucri*, 49).

The interpretation that Laocoon presents might be correct: he is
certainly right, after all, to try to reveal the sinister contents that
the monumental facade hides. That does him little good, though, as he
cannot pierce the exterior to the truth underneath:

> sic fatus ualidis ingentem uiribus hastam
> in latus inque feri curuam compagibus aluum
> contorsit. stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso
> insonuere cauae gemitumque dedere cauernae (*Aen*. 2.50-53)
>
> When he had said this \[Laocoon\] hurled his great spear with mighty
> strength into the side of the beast, into the belly round with joints.
> The spear stood there trembling, and at the strike of the womb the
> hollow caverns echoed and let go a groan.

In this passage, too, the reader can see again not only the suggestion
that the “beast” is in some way pregnant (*curuum*...*aluum*, 51;
*uteroque recusso*, 52), but also the image of the Horse as a kind of
cave: the “hollow caverns” (*cavae*…*cavernae*, 53) resound and give a
groan when struck by the priest’s weapon. Laocoon’s actions might even
remind the reader of the way that Aeolus used his spear to release the
winds and set them about on their rampage: as the king of the winds is
said to have struck the mountain with his spear (*cauum conuersa cuspide
montem* / *impulit in latus*, *Aen*. 1.81-82), Laocoon also strikes into
the side of the horse (*in latus*, 51) with his spear (*hastam*, 50).
Yet even if he is able to hit the structure, the priest is unable to
reveal what lies beneath its surface within the Horse’s artificially
constructed cavern.[^287]

Laocoon is not the builder of the Horse. Unlike Aeolus, moreover, the
Trojan priest is not the owner of the “beast,” either. It is as a mere
spectator that Laocoon fails in his attempt to display the *error* that
lies hidden within the facade. His inability to reveal the hidden
meaning of the structure is not insignificant, however, when compared to
the much different outcome that the Greek “runaway” Sinon encounters
upon his explanation of the Horse’s meaning. Sinon is in fact much more
successful in the way that he determines the meaning of the Horse and
its monumental size for its Trojan onlookers. And it is important for
the discussion of Vergilian *monumenta* below in the following chapter
to consider the reasons for Sinon’s success in contrast to the failure
of Laocoon to control the meaning of the structure.

Below is what the crafty Greek claims in response to Priam’s question as
to why this *moles* of a Horse was built in the first place:

> hanc pro Palladia moniti, pro numine laesa
> effigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.
> hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem
> roboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,
> ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset
> neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri. (*Aen*. 2.183-188)
>
> They constructed this effigy at \[Calchus’\] warning on behalf of the
> Palladium, for the sake of the wounded divine will, so that it could
> atone for their grim crime. Yet Calchus ordered them to erect this
> immense *moles* of woven oak and build it to the sky, in order that it
> could not be received by your gates or led into your walls, and so
> that it could not watch over your people in the course of their
> ancient religious rites.

It was the Greek prophet Calchas, according to Sinon, who ordered the
Greeks to “erect this immense *moles*” (*hanc...immmensam...attollere
molem*, 185) in order to atone for stealing the Palladium from Troy. The
sly Greek makes it look like a regular (albeit massive) offering: he
uses none of the language that seeks to blur the distinction between
natural and artificial – not even calling the structure a “horse” at any
point. He focuses on the grand exterior, explaining that structure was
built so big that it would be able neither to be led into gates and
walls of a city (cf. *ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset*, 187)
nor to be worshipped under the Trojans’ traditional religion (cf. *neu
populurn antiqua sub religione tueri*, 188).[^288]

By focusing on the exterior Sinon succeeds where Laocoon failed in
persuading his fellow onlookers of the meaning of the monumental
*moles*.[^289] And the inclusion of the Horse in the city despite
Sinon’s rhetorical “warnings” is significant for illustrating the
effects that grand facades can have on their spectators. The Trojans are
completely unaware of the import of what they are doing and refuse to
see the clear signs of trouble: for instance, when the Horse halts four
times on the threshold and the weapons that it contains rattle, the
inhabitants of the city seem oblivious (*immemores*) to the sounds that
the beast makes and instead “blinded with fury” (*caeci*...*furore*)
place the *monstrum* in the center of the city (cf. *Aen*.
2.240-243).[^290] Again, it is important for the discussion below in
Chapter V to stress here the effects that this kind of monumental
architecture can have on people – that is, to make them *immemores* of,
or *caeci* to, what could lie behind a grand facade, or what monsters of
one’s past a monumental structure could contain.

The Trojan Horse therefore demonstrates another important element of the
failed structures in the poem, namely, the way that a monumental
exterior can make those who behold a massive *moles* unmindful of what
fury of the past it could be concealing. The need for a critical
approach to reading beneath the surface of such structures is suggested
not only by Laocoon’s inability to persuade his fellow Trojans to look
beyond the awesome facade of the Horse; more than that, it is the
relative ease with which Sinon tricks the Trojans by focusing their
attention on the Horse’s extraordinary frame that makes an ability to
read beneath the surface so critical. The Trojans are blinded by the
monumental facade of the horse – and it costs them dearly. The poet’s
narrative of the Trojan Horse is thus similar to his account of Cacus’
cave in the way that it too should make one suspicious of architecture’s
ability to contain the chaos inherent to the past in the Vergil’s story
of Rome. The poet’s telling of Troy’s downfall warns his readers at the
same time to be suspicious of monumental structures, in particular,
especially those whose splendid exteriors can make one forgetful of the
chaos that might lie below their marvelous surfaces.

The close parallel of the Horse’s imagery with that of Aeolus’ Cave in
the previous book of the poem should again make the reader consider
whether it is wise (or even possible) to hold at bay the forces of chaos
from the past that these cavernous *moles* contain. Is the Temple of
Janus – a structure placed at the center of Rome as the Horse was at
Troy – another construction that could eventually fail and let loose
again the violent chaos of Rome’s past? The Trojan Horse and the Cave of
Aeolus do not offer the epic’s readers much confidence in architecture’s
ability to contain such a force; if anything, in fact, they demonstrate
vividly the disaster which the release of such a force can wreak,
whether on a city or the world at large.

####(iii) Cacus’ Cave####

In Book 8 of the poem Aeneas sees the site that eventually will become
Rome. And even at that time in the distant past there are *monumenta*
there. Evander is Aeneas’ guide and reveals to him “the remains and
monuments of the men of old” (*reliquias ueterumque...monumenta
uirorum*, *Aen*. 8.356, cf. 8.312). The next chapter will examine
exactly what such *monumenta* might mean to Evander, to Aeneas, and to
the contemporary Roman reader. It is necessary first, however, to look
at another important constructed cave that appears in this book of the
poem, namely, the Cave of Cacus. This cave also contains an evil,
chaotic force that existed in Rome’s distant past – on the very site of
Rome no less – in ways not dissimilar to Aeolus’ Cave and the Trojan
Horse examined above. The crucial difference with the failure of this
final cavernous *moles* is the way that the destructive force within can
also affect those who actively break open the structure to engage with
it – even in the attempt to rid the world of such a chaos permanently.

The Trojans sail on the Tiber to the Greek colony of Pallanteum and are
received hospitably at a feast in which the dislocated Greeks under
Evander are participating. After both peoples have taken in such
festivities Evander tells Aeneas what exactly it is that they are
celebrating: it is not some “empty superstition” (*uana superstitio*,
*Aen*. 8.187) that established the ritual, he informs his Trojan guest,
but rather the fact that his people were “saved from severe dangers”
(*saevis...periclis* / *seruati*, 8.188-189). The Greek king then goes
on to relate the story of how Hercules rescued them all from Cacus, a
fire-breathing monster that had terrorized the region until the
demigod’s arrival – all while pointing to the very place where the
violent struggle happened. The following lines are the beginning of his
description:

> iam primum saxis suspensam hanc aspice rupem,
> disiectae procul ut moles desertaque montis
> stat domus et scopuli ingentem traxere ruinam.
> hic spelunca fuit uasto summota recessu,
> semihominis Caci facies quam dira tenebat
> solis inaccessam radiis; semperque recenti
> caede tepebat humus, foribusque adfixa superbis
> ora uirum tristi pendebant pallida tabo.
> huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros
> ore uomens ignis magna se mole ferebat. (*Aen*. 8.190-199)
>
> Now first take a look at this cliff, rocky and overhanging, how
> *moles* have been scattered far and wide, how a deserted mountain home
> stands there, and how the boulders have drawn done a mighty collapse.
> Here set back in a vast recess was the cave that the terrible
> appearance of the half-man Cacus was possessing – a cave inaccessible
> to the rays of the sun. Always the ground was warm with recent
> slaughter, always fastened to his haughty doors were dangling the
> heads of men pale with grim gore. Vulcan was this monster’s father: it
> was *his* black fires that Cacus would vomit from his mouth while he
> was bearing the great mass of himself.

Here again is a “cave” (*spelunca*, 193).[^291] And once again it does
not seem to be entirely natural. It has been “set back in a vast recess”
from the mountain, Evander tells Aeneas, made into a “home” (*domus*)
for Cacus (192-193). It is indeed another *moles* – albeit one that has
been destroyed already (cf. *disiectae...moles*, 191) and is now lying
in ruin. Vulcan is the father of this “half-human” (*semihominis*, 194),
massive, fire-vomiting “monster” (*monstro*, 198). As the reader learns
a little later, moreover, it was by the fire god’s own craftsmanship
(*arte paterna*, 8.226) that the “cave” has a means of closing.[^292]
Although it might then appear initially like a natural phenomenon,
Cacus’ Cave is thus similar to the other “caves” examined above: it too
serves as a constructed object that hides a force of pure destruction –
of evil itself, in fact, as the monster’s name implies[^293] – which
stands in the way of civilization and the attempt to establish
order.[^294]

There is an important difference between this cavernous *moles* and the
previous ones, however. Although Aeolus is not the builder of his cave,
the king of the winds is in control of the chaos that lives within his
cave – and he opens it under his own will. With the Trojan Horse,
moreover, the Greeks who constructed it are the ones that break the seal
and wreak their havoc upon the city (though Laocoon tried his best to
reveal the *error* that lurked within the beast). In the case of Cacus’
Cave, on the other hand, the evil is *unwillingly* exposed by Hercules,
who not only breaks open the *moles* (and breaks it apart), but also
enters it in order to confront the destructive force that lies hidden
within.

There are significant similarities, as one might expect, between how
Hercules opens the cave and the way that both Aeolus breaks open his own
one in Book 1 and Laocoon attempts to pierce the ones in Trojan Horse in
Book 2, as the following passage makes clear:

> hanc, ut prona iugo laeuum incumbebat ad amnem,
> dexter in aduersum nitens concussit et imis
> auulsam soluit radicibus, **inde repente **
> **impulit; impulsu quo maximus intonat aether**
> **dissultant ripae refluitque exterritus amnis**. (*Aen*. 8.236-240)
>
> Once \[Hercules\] had shaken this \[stone\] with all his effort from
> the right side, as it lay sloping along its ridge to the river on the
> left, and loosened it having ripped it up from its lowermost roots,
> **he then suddenly struck it. The upper air thunders loudly at such a
> blow, the riverbanks jump back, and the river terrified reverses its
> course**.

Hercules through his great strength removes a giant stone so that he can
gain access to the top of the cave in which Cacus has hid himself. In
order to accomplish this, he had to “strike” (cf. *impulit*, 239) it
with all his force – a strike that makes the upper air thunder and
causes the river itself to reverse its course.[^295] It is significant
that *impulit* is enjambed in the same position at the beginning of the
line as when Vergil narrates how Aeolus “struck” his cave (cf. *Aen*.
1.81-82). That is not the only similarity, though, which links the two
events: both strikes result in thunderstorms (cf. *Aen*. 1.81-91); more
than that, the blow is so great that it too disrupts the established
order of things in making the river reverse its course (*refluitque
exterritus amnis*, 240) – just as the winds had made what was on the
bottom of the sea suddenly rise to the top.[^296]

Hercules thus opens the cave as Aeolus does and thereby succeeds where
Laocoon failed. Yet there is still a price he must pay for breaking open
this divinely-built structure and unleashing the chaotic forces within.
Something happens to the hero upon his entry into the primordial chaos
that the cave seeks to contain and hide: Hercules becomes very much like
the monster that he is trying to vanquish.[^297] Cacus’ Cave is a dark
place – not only because the rays of the sun cannot access it (cf.
*solis inaccessam radiis*, 8.195), but also because of the “black fires”
(*atros*...*ignis*, 8.199-200) which Cacus vomits from his mouth.[^298]
And this darkness seems to envelop and penetrate Hercules himself as he
fights against the monster in his lair:

> ille autem, neque enim fuga iam super ulla pericli,
> faucibus ingentem fumum (mirabile dictu)
> euomit inuoluitque domum caligine caeca
> prospectum eripiens oculis, glomeratque sub antra
> fumiferam noctem commixtis igne tenebris.
> non tulit Alcides animis seque ipse per ignem
> praecipiti iecit saltu, qua plurimus undam
> fumus agit nebulaque ingens specus aestuat atra. (*Aen*. 8.251-258)
>
> [Cacus], on the other hand, since there was now no more escape from
> danger, vomits forth a great cloud of smoke from his jaws (marvelous
> to say) and envelops his home with a blinding darkness, snatching
> sight from [Hercules’] eyes. He gathers in his cave a smoke-filled
> night with shadows mixed together with flame. Hercules did not endure
> this in his spirit and threw himself with a headlong jump through the
> fire, where the thickest smoke came in waves and the vast cavern
> seethed in a black cloud.

The fire which Cacus “vomits forth” (*evomit*, 253) envelops the cave in
a “blinding darkness” (*caligne caeca*, 253). Much as the winds in Book
1 which snatch away the sight from the eyes of the Trojans and bring
about an untimely night (cf. *Aen*. 1.88-89), Cacus also takes the sight
from Hercules’ eyes (*prospectum eripiens oculis*, 254) and manifests in
his cave a “smoke-filled night” (*fumiferam noctem*, 255). None of this
darkness deters Hercules, however, as the hero throws himself with a
“headlong jump” (*preaecipiti*…*saltu*, 257) right into the middle of
the flames and the shadows. Heroic as these actions may be, Vergil’s
description (via Evander) of what happens next suggests that Hercules
has lost control of himself as a result of his rage:

> hic Cacum in tenebris incendia uana uomentem
> corripit in nodum complexus et angit inhaerens
> elisos ocules et siccum sanguine guttur.
>
> […]
>
> ...pedibusque informe cadauer
> protrahitur. nequeunt expleri corda tuendo
> terribilis oculos, uultum uillosaque saetis
> pectora semiferi atque exstinctos faucibus ignis. (*Aen*. 8.259-261,
> 264-267)
>
> Wrapping him into a knot [Hercules] seizes Cacus vomiting vain fires
> in the shadows and gripping him tight he chokes him until his eyes
> popped out and his throat is dry with blood. [...] The hideous
> cadaver is dragged out by the feet. Our hearts cannot get enough of
> seeing the terrible eyes of the beast, his face, his chest shaggy with
> hairs, and the fires from his jaws extinguished.

Although Cacus is a horrible monster, of course, and one that has
terrorized humankind for many years (and has stolen Hercules’
cattle),[^299] the way that the hero kills the beast in this passage is
rather gruesome, perhaps even excessive, as he strangles the half-human
being to the point that Cacus’ eyes pop out (*angit...elisos ocules*,
260-261).[^300] Moreover, even while Evander and his people derive a
twisted sort of pleasure from seeing Cacus’ dead body, the detail that
Vergil gives to the scene – with the corpse being dragged out by his
feet to be gawked at by the onlookers – has almost a twinge of sympathy.
The poet had shown such sympathy before, after all, for another
“monster” (*monstrum*, 3.658) back in Book 3: the blinded Polyphemus who
can himself be seen as a model for Cacus with his own barbaric behavior
in Book 9 of Homer’s *Odyssey*.

This fire-breathing monster has been brought low. But at what cost? It
is not too much to suggest – as several scholars have – that when the
hero enters the darkness of the cave he loses control of himself and a
sense of his own humanity.[^301] He would not be the first one in the
poem to do this: Aeneas also enters a *spelunca* in book 4 and forgets
himself and his mission, becoming *immemores* together with Dido.[^302]
And the chaos that is unleashed from Aeolus’ *antrum* and the “caverns”
within the Trojan Horse when they are opened should not be forgotten,
either. Caves in the *Aeneid* represent a place where darkness and chaos
dominate – a place where the repressed forces of chaos that overturn any
attempt to establish order can find a “home” (*domus*, 8.192). When a
hero enters such a cave (or tries to in the case of Laocoon) these
forces are unleashed upon him – ending either with his destruction, as
with Laocoon, or the breakdown of his very humanity, as seems to happen
even to the heroic son of Jove.

Cacus’ Cave is thus another case of “failed” architecture in the poem.
Unlike in the previous two examples, however, it is not so much because
the chaos inside breaks out. In the episode in Book 8 it is rather
because the dark chaos of Rome’s past surrounds and temporarily traps
the one who breaks open the structure in the attempt to destroy it. The
result is a hero who becomes a monster while inside the construction –
even if momentarily and for seemingly justifiable reasons. Even when one
attempts to rid the world of these forces, in other words, it comes at a
price, and with no certainty of any sort of lasting success.

Hercules is perhaps not the only “hero” to undergo such a transformation
in Book 8, however. The Cave of Cacus is built by his divine father
Vulcan, but it is not the only (or the most famous) work of the divine
craftsman in this book of the poem. The fire god also makes Aeneas’
shield which is described at length by the poet towards the end of
*Aeneid* 8.[^303] This shield tells a version of Roman history through
the pictures on its surface, with one such image depicting Augustus
himself:

> hinc Augustus agens Italos in proelia Caesar
> cum patribus populoque, penatibus et magnis dis,
> stans celsa in puppi, geminas cui tempora flammas
> laeta uomunt patriumque aperitur uertice sidus. (*Aen*. 8.680-683)
>
> From this side Augustus Caesar leading Italians into battle together
> with the senate and the people, together with the household gods and
> the great gods, standing on his high ship, the sides of his head
> bounteously vomiting twin flames, and his father’s star appears on his
> top.

Augustus is depicted here as “vomiting” flames from the sides of his
head (cf. *tempora flamma*…*vomunt*, 862-863).[^304] A reader might be
reminded here of another figure in the book whose actions are also
described with the verb *vomere*, namely, Cacus himself who is said to
be doing so three separate times: *vomens* at 8.199, *evomit* at 8.253,
and *vomentem* at 8.259.[^305] This section has demonstrated that
Hercules becomes like the monster that he kills – even if it was to the
benefit of the people of the proto-Rome – as he too “blazed with furies”
(*furiis exarserat*, 219) in his battle with Cacus. Augustus has tamed
his own monstrous *Furor*, namely, the one which dwells inside the
Temple of Janus in Book 1. What did it cost him to confront and subdue
this monster? What structures of Rome’s past did he have to destroy in
that battle? And what does it do to those who try to tame the darkness
and violence that disrupt any attempt to establish (or re-establish)
order? Those are some of the questions that the episode surrounding
Cacus’ Cave raises for anyone – whether a god or a man, whether an
Aeneas or an Augustus – who tries to subjugate the destructive and
violent chaos of Rome’s story that is bound only temporarily within the
poem’s constructed caves.

The three “caves” examined above present us with one type of “failed”
architecture that attempts to impose structure on the chaotic forces of
the past in Vergil’s poem. These *moles* are revealed to be unstable
constructions: their boundaries fail to contain the chaotic fury of
Rome’s past – a violent force that can upset the ordered structures of
the cosmos, of the city, and even of one’s own humanity. The labyrinths
in the poem represent another set of structures that attempt to contain
and conceal such forces. In a similar way to the caves in the *Aeneid*,
however, it is their “failure” to keep this chaos of the past at bay
which the poem demonstrates for its readers.

###Part 2. Labyrinths of Meaning###

As difficult as it might be to escape from labyrinths – to find that one
“right” way out – it is similarly no easy task to understand their
symbolic value. Penelope Doob in her wide-ranging study on the idea of
the labyrinth in Western literature speaks of a constant “double
perspective” that one must consider when one is attempting to comprehend
the meaning of these structures. Labyrinths are incredible feats of
humankind – architectural masterpieces that elicited awe from those who
saw or even read about them in antiquity.[^306] At the same time,
however, labyrinths are also buildings that seem to lack a solid
structure and organization to anyone who must enter and eventually
escape them.[^307] As Doob puts it,

> \[w\]hat you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the
> same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and
> double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity
> and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos.[^308]

For many modern (and post-modern) authors and architects, it is the
latter of these two perspectives that has made the labyrinth a perfect
symbol for their own struggles with meaning and language.[^309] Walter
Benjamin thought of “the modern experience” as “labyrinthine.”[^310] And
the architectural writer Carl Jencks defined as “Post-Modern” any space
that “suspends the clear, final ordering of events for a labyrinthine,
rambling ‘way’ that never reaches an absolute goal.”[^311] For the
semiotician Umberto Eco, moreover, “the universe of semiosis can be
postulated in the format of a labyrinth.”[^312] It is not, then, that
labyrinths have no meaning or structure; it is rather that they might
have too many meanings within a seemingly shifting structure. One might
even go so far as Roland Barthes in discussing another great monument –
the Eiffel Tower – to say that the labyrinth is similarly “impossible to
escape, *because it means everything*.”[^313] Labyrinths are thus at
once architectural wonders *and* structures that seem to defy the very
idea of a stable architecture.[^314]

This double nature of architecture should already be somewhat familiar
from the cavernous *moles* of the *Aeneid* examined in the previous part
of this chapter. The labyrinths of the poem are likewise shown to
present something on the surface that seems very stable and/or that
delights while also “cracking open” to reveal darker, violent forces
from the past that lie hidden beneath. With the labyrinth, however,
there is a transition from the literal breakdown of boundaries to a more
metaphorical collapse of the frame that allows the chaotic forces to
escape. Although the figure of the labyrinth is a motif that has been
demonstrated by scholars to run throughout the *Aeneid*,[^315] the focus
of this section will be on the two times such structures are explicitly
mentioned in close proximity, that is, near the end of Book 5 during the
*Lusus Troiae* and at the beginning of Book 6 in the ecphrasis of
Daedalus’ doors. In both instances, I argue below, these structures
amaze their spectators and yet are instable and ultimately fail to
contain the chaos of the past that they are built to conceal.

####(i) The Labyrinthine *Lusus Troiae*####

The first time that the poet mentions a labyrinth explicitly occurs in a
simile comparing the mythical edifice to the intricate twists and turns
of the mock-battle between the Trojan youths known as the *Lusus
Troiae*:

> ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta
> parietibus textum caecis iter ancipitemque
> mille uiis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi
> frangeret indeprensus et inremeabilis error:
> haud alio Teucrum nati uestigia cursu
> impediunt texuntque fugas et proelia ludo… (*Aen*. 5.589-594)
>
> As it is said that the labyrinth on high Crete once possessed a path
> woven amid blinding walls and a trick deceptive with its thousand
> turns, where *error* that was untraceable and unsolvable would break
> the signs to follow: in a not at all different course did the sons of
> the Trojans arrange their steps and weave retreats and battles in
> their play…

The comparison here between the labyrinth and the games helps to
illustrate the high level of intricacy and complexity of the boys’
maneuvers.[^316] The Cretan labyrinth was a marvel, after all, and one
that was highly praised in antiquity for just such a reason.[^317] Yet
the association between the details of this building and the boys’
spectacle might seem rather odd. The focus of the description is not so
much on the labyrinth’s complexity as it is on the deceptive nature of
the structure: its walls deprive one of sight (cf.
*parietibus...caecis*, 590), and it contains a deceptive trick
(*ancipitem...dolum*, 590-591) due to its many, winding paths; even more
than that, though, the labyrinth is a place where one can see neither
where one has gone nor where one should go, trapping one in a constant
state of *error* – an *indeprensus et inremeablis error* (592).[^318]

The emphasis of Vergil’s simile is on the way that the labyrinth traps
whoever enters it. That is surely not the quality which one would expect
of a spectacle that is said to bring pleasure and a feeling of pride to
its spectators. The poet has already told the reader that the Trojans
“receive the timid [boys] with applause, rejoice at the sight of
them…and recognize in them the faces of their old parents” (*excipiunt
plausu pauidos gaudentque tuentes...ueterumque agnoscunt ora parentum*,
*Aen*. 5.575-576). Let us think for a moment about this pleasure,
though. It seems significant that the joy which the Trojans experience
from watching the show comes from recognizing the past in the faces of
their future. This is not, however, the past of Troy with which the
readers of the poem are most familiar. The Troy that they have seen is
merely a ruin, a place that was destroyed right before their eyes during
Aeneas’ graphic narrative of the city’s sack in Book 2. It might seem
therefore that *Lusus Troiae* is helping the Trojans on one level, at
least, in the way that it allows them to forget about the recent
disaster that befell their homeland and at the same time to remember
events of Troy’s past that bring happiness to their hearts.

If this is the case, though, why is there all the talk of deception in
the simile that describes these same maneuvers? One way to answer this
question, I would argue, is to suggest that the simile is emphasizing
how the Trojans are “trapped” in a past they choose to remember,
smoothing over the destruction of Troy that must still be paramount in
their minds. The windings and twisting of the boys seem to be enough, in
other words, to make the weary wanderers forget for a moment about the
horrors that occurred at Troy and in the aftermath of its fall. The
labyrinthine movements of the boys help to conceal a dark, chaotic time
in the Trojans’ past – to frame it in an elaborate fiction that presents
to the Trojans only what they want to remember.[^319] It is only able to
accomplish this, however, for as long as the show lasts. The Trojan
women bring that *furor* back into their minds soon enough by burning
the ships while the Trojan men are watching this mesmerizing
spectacle.[^320] The labyrinthine dance thus proves a rather costly
distraction for the Trojans: its complex borders and frames cannot
actually keep the chaos of the past at bay for very long.[^321]

It is not only the past that must enter into one’s understanding of this
simile, but the future of Rome, as well. Soon after the simile that
juxtaposes the *Lusus Troiae* to the Cretan Labyrinth (and before the
Trojan women’s attack) the poet interrupts the narrative to discuss how
this ritual would become very important to his own contemporary society:

> hunc morem cursus atque haec certamina primus,
> Ascanius, Longam muris cum cingeret Albam,
> rettulit et priscos docuit celebrare Latinos,
> quo puer ipse modo, secum quo Troia pubes;
> Albani docuere suos; hinc maxima porro
> accepit Roma et patrium seruauit honorem;
> Troiaque nunc pueri, Troianum dicitur agmen. (*Aen*. 5.596-602)
>
> Ascanius was the first to bring back this kind of course and these
> games, when he was encircling Alba Long with walls, and taught the
> ancient Latins to celebrate them in the way that he as a boy had
> himself done, in the way that the Trojan youth had done with him. The
> Albans taught their own. From there greatest Rome later on received
> and kept the rite of their ancestors. Today the boys are called “Troy”
> and the column “Trojan.”

Why does the poet choose this moment to make explicit the aetiology of
the event?[^322] Although the *Lusus Troiae* probably first appeared as
an event in Rome in the time of Sulla (and Caesar used it in his triumph
in 46 BCE), it was Augustus who revived the “games” on a greater
scale.[^323] The aetiology might then be a way, it has been suggested,
of “complimenting Augustus by tracing the origin of the *lusus Troiae*
to Aeneas and Ascanius.”[^324] However, the close proximity of this
aetiology to the rather dark labyrinth simile might also lead a reader
to understand this association in a less positive light.[^325] It might
even be possible, for instance, to see the revival of the games as
another attempt to give order to the chaos of a grim past of conflict –
just as the games do for the Trojans who see them performed for the
first time.[^326] Is the attempt successful? At first, yes, it is, as
the boys repeat the past in such a way as to bring pleasure to the
Trojans. Yet this repetition distracts the Trojans not only from the
horrors of their past that still follow them but also from the fact that
they have not yet reached the solid land of Italy; and while they enjoy
the spectacle, the Trojan women try to destroy their fleet.

The labyrinth that the boys weave with their maneuvers conceals the
chaos of the past that eventually does not stay subdued within the
boundaries of their art. If understood in this way the labyrinth is
employed in this passage to suggest how a structure that almost defies
structure can trap its beholder in a constructed past through its many
turns. The figure of the labyrinth cannot be controlled so easily,
however.[^327] While the labyrinth might make the Trojans feel free from
the always present sense of chaos in their past, as well as the one in
their uncertain future, the poem demonstrates how that very same
architectural frame is unstable and ultimately “fails” to control that
chaos permanently. A labyrinth aims to entrap those who enter its
boundaries, distracting them with its complexity while simultaneously
letting go something more sinister as the boundaries between inside and
outside shift. And if a labyrinth – one of the great structures in the
ancient world – cannot succeed in containing such a *furor*, what faith
should one put in the Temple of Janus to keep at bay the *Furor* of
Rome’s own recent past?

####(ii) The Labyrinthine Art of Daedalus####

The labyrinthine spectacle of the *Lusus Troiae* alerts readers of the
epic to the way that labyrinths can trap those who enter their winding,
innumerable paths; in an even more nuanced way, though, Vergil’s
narrative of the games also demonstrate how labyrinths can for a time at
least keep certain aspects of the past hidden, imposing a highly complex
artistic frame – a fiction of sorts – that conceals something that one
might want to forget. At the same time, however, such “labyrinths” fail
to impose a permanent, stable structure on the chaotic, destructive
forces of the past that could break out of them at any moment. They can
provide momentary relief from the horrors of the past, in other words,
but they cannot keep them from repeating.

The next labyrinth that the reader encounters in the poem shares many of
these same characteristics. It is again not part of the narrative, *per
se*, but a small piece of an ecphrasis that details the life and works
of the great craftsman Daedalus on the doors which he designed for the
temple of Apollo upon his arrival at Cumae.[^328] As with the labyrinth
simile in Book 5, moreover, Daedalus’ labyrinth “fails” as a structure
to keep hidden the monsters and *errores* of the past that it was
designed to conceal; if anything, in fact, such chaos is shown *through*
Daedalus’ own art to break out of the architectural structure that
frames it and thereby to re-enter the present.

After the ships are saved by Jupiter from the Trojan women’s fury Aeneas
sails to Italy and finally makes landfall at Cumae at the start of Book
6. He stops there in front of the doors of the temple of Apollo on his
way to see the Sibyl to gaze at the reliefs carved upon them. This scene
will be examined again in more detail in the following chapter that
looks at the *monumenta* of the poem.[^329] For now, the focus will be
on the labyrinth itself that is represented on the doors’ panels, as
shown in the below passage:

> hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
> Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
> Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
> hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.
> magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
> Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
> caeca regens filo uestigia. (*Aen*. 6.25-31)
>
> Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
> beneath \[it\] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
> the Minotaur, the *monumenta* of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
> that toil of the house and the inescapable *error*. But indeed
> Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen’s great love unlocks the
> tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.

The labyrinth was meant to conceal the Minotaur within its highly
complex weaving of paths that the poet labels as *inextricabilis* (28),
“from which one cannot find a way \[out\].”[^330] Yet this structure
does not seem inescapable from the description of it here. Daedalus
himself actually “opens up” the labyrinth by solving the very maze that
he built to trap those who enter it (cf. *Daedalus ipse dolos tecti
ambagesque resoluit*, / *caeca regens filo uestigia*, 30-31).[^331] Nor
does the labyrinth depicted on the doors even hide the Minotaur: the
beast – and the sinful affair it represents – is actually freed from the
darkness of the labyrinth and displayed as on the doors for all to see.

The architect can thus be said to break open his labyrinth: not only
does he solve it in the myth itself; in a more unintentional way
perhaps, he is also re-presenting to Aeneas (and the reader) the
“failure” of his own construction to contain what was supposed to lie
hidden by depicting the Minotaur on the doors and his own unlocking of
the maze. Daedalus’ labyrinth is not just an example of “failed”
architecture, therefore, but a *representation* of such failure.[^332]
The master craftsman (as well as the poet describing his work) crascks
open the labyrinth through his own art by revealing how to escape its
twists and turns, its *errores*, as well as by depicting the monster
that lies within them. In this way, then, the edifice might serve as a
*mise en abyme* for the poem itself – a poem which I have argued also
reveals the violent chaos of the past that exists within several
structures meant to contain it.[^333]

But what effect does such a release have? In the narrative, at least, it
might seem like the outcome is rather negligible: Aeneas simply marvels
at such *spectacula* (6.37) before the Sibyl comes and diverts his
attention to more urgent matters.[^334] As William Fitzgerald suggests,
however, the passage allows the labyrinth in the *Aeneid* to emerge as

> a complex symbol of the status of the past. It is both a highly
> elaborate artistic work that freezes the past in a harmlessly
> discontinuous relation with the present and, as an instigator of
> repetition that transforms pattern into path, it offers the
> possibility of reactivating that past and assimilating it into the
> flow of history.[^335]

Fitzgerald may be right to claim that labyrinths offer the “possibility”
of bringing the past into a structured frame. It is only a possibility,
though, and the results are only provisional at best, as additional
analysis of this passage in the next chapter will reveal. By
representing the monsters of Rome’s violent past can the *Aeneid*
provide a frame for containing them? Or does it run the risk of
revealing and releasing what would rather be forgotten? Once again, the
question arises of whether architectural structures – even architecture
as intricate as that of a labyrinth – can really provide a permanent,
stable frame that prevents the *furor* of Rome’s past from breaking free
of its bounds.

This chapter has demonstrated that grand constructions such as cavernous
*moles* and intricate labyrinths offer only the illusion of creating a
frame that can contain the past within a stable narrative. The following
chapter will show how the boundaries of monuments in the *Aeneid* also
appear to be ineffectual in containing the chaos of the past that they
represent within their artistic frames. As with the labyrinths examined
above, moreover, the failure of the poem’s *monumenta* is not so much in
the collapse of their physical boundaries as it is in a breakdown of
their epistemological borders – which results in the release of the
*errores* of the past so that they can repeat in the present. The same
can be said for the *Aeneid* itself and its epic architexture as
symbolized in magnificent Baldric of Pallas, whose resplendent frame is
unable to keep the *furor* in Rome’s past at bay.

The poem does not show the “cracks” in its epic architexture to a wholly
negative end, however. The failure of its architexture to provide a
stable structure that can conceal and contain permanently the chaos it
holds within it demonstrates at the same time the need to be aware of
the fury that exists behind a monumental facade. For it is by being able
to read beneath what one sees on the surface, I will argue, that the
*Aeneid* shows how one can best prepare for – and perhaps even prevent –
such a collapse of structure from occurring in the first place.

[^233]: The Latin text of this passage from the *Georgics* is from
    Mynors 1969. For the text of the *Aeneid*, however, I will be using
    the recent Teubner edition of Conte 2009.

[^234]: See Hinds 1998, 54-56, for a discussion of the Ennian intertext
    with which these lines are in dialogue.

[^235]: Otis 1964 \[1995\], 38-39, argues that it should be “apparent to
    anyone who grasps the meaning of the symbolic description of the
    future epic” that the referent here is indeed the *Aeneid*. See also
    Richter 1957 and Fleischer 1960 for a similar point of view.

[^236]: For further discussion of this passage see also: Wilkinson 1969;
    Buchheit 1972, 92-159; Putnam 1979, 165-74; Meban 2008; J. F. Miller
    2009; and now Dufallo 2013, 108-136.

[^237]: Cf. Hor. *C*. 3.30.1. See above, pp. 74-79, for discussion of
    Horace’s famous *sphragis* to his first collection of *Odes*.

[^238]: This interest in the interior space of architecture is perhaps
    characteristically Roman – in part, at least, because of the Romans’
    ability to create much more dynamic spaces with the invention of
    concrete construction in the latter half of 2<sup>nd</sup> Century BCE. For
    the importance of this innovation for architecture, see Ling 1988,
    1672-1689, arguing that the ability to shape interior space through
    concrete was “Rome’s great legacy to posterity.” As Ward-Perkins
    1981 \[1994\], 101, points out, in fact, “\[a\]lready...in the Roman
    architecture of the Late Republic one can detect a growing awareness
    of the properties of interior space.” For a modern perspective of
    this issue, see also Wright 1928, 148-149, where the famous modern
    architect discusses Greek architecture as “a mere matter of
    constructing decoration” that led to a building that could be seen
    as “a block of building material…from the outside” with no attention
    to what existed within. The Romans adopted the architecture of the
    Greeks, of course, but with an attention to interior spaces that was
    previously less significant. In a way similar to much modern
    architecture in Wright’s estimation, Vergil’s *monumentum* of a text
    also seeks for “exterior expression” (149), that is, to give a voice
    to what a monument’s facade might conceal.

[^239]: Cf. Verg. *G*. 3.28-29: *atque hic undantem bello magnumque
    fluentem* / *Nilum ac nauali surgentis aere columnas*. See Dufallo
    2013 for an analysis of how this *templum* does more than make a
    statement concerning Vergil’s own poetry. “Vergil’s temple may be a
    (future) text,” Dufallo suggests, “but it is, more significantly, a
    statement of the numinous power with which Octavian, through his
    link to Apollo, fills both Rome and Vergil’s own poetry” (116).

[^240]: See Bartsch 1998, 325, where she calls these sorts of boundaries
    the “*compages artis*” of the poem. I accept several of the
    positions argued for in Putnam 1965 (and several later studies of
    the scholar) regarding the inherent “violence” of Vergil’s epic
    cosmos, and I will refer to him below in cases where I touch upon
    the same passages in the poem that the scholar analyzes.

[^241]: For a brief but engaging discussion of the *Aeneid* as “a poem
    of history” see Feeney 1992 \[1993\], 94-96, where his argument
    focuses upon the idea that “the poem is very interested in the flux
    which always makes it hard to impose \[a\] fixed pattern” of
    interpretation on the past, as well as that of the future. See also
    Johnson 1976, 133, asserting that “Vergil’s subject is, in large
    measure, how men and nations behaved in the past, how they tend now
    to behave, and why. \[...\] \[T\]he longer Vergil pondered his
    contents and design, the more his poem came to be about the nature
    of history.” I will argue that it is in its nuanced treatment of
    architecture – the very thing that makes history possible in the
    poem – that the *Aeneid* directs one of its most engaging critiques
    of historical narrative.

[^242]: See Labate 1991, Morwood 1991, and now also Reitz 2013, 126-136.

[^243]: See Morwood 1991, 218-219, for an extensive list of such
    allusions. In more recent scholarship, Harrison 2006 can be seen as
    typical of an approach that examines monuments in the poem in direct
    contrast to, and comparison with, those in the Augustan reality.

[^244]: See Elsner 2007 for studies representative of an approach that
    emphasizes the ways in which texts can help us understand better the
    visuality of Roman culture.

[^245]: Of course, Vergil was not the first ancient poet to mix history
    and epic. The Hellenistic poet Apollonius Rhodius and the Romans
    Naevius and Ennius all did so before their Augustan successor. See
    M. F. Williams 1991, 187-188, arguing that the text of the
    *Argonautica* is filled with “visible monuments” for the purpose of
    “combining history and mythology.”

[^246]: My reading of architecture in the *Aeneid* as “failing” to
    maintain its boundaries is influenced by Bartsch 1998. In this
    article on the ecphraseis of the poem Bartsch remarks on several of
    the same objects that I analyze in the current chapter, as well as
    in the next one (e.g., the Trojan horse, the Doors of Daedalus,
    Pallas’ Baldric). Bartsch likewise notes the problem with the
    boundaries of art to contain violent and chaotic forces that disrupt
    meaning and upset the established order of things, claiming that
    “the artworks of the *Aeneid* participate in this economy of values
    that sets control and containment against the consequences of an
    impassioned violence. This attribute of the Virgilian artwork is
    counterbalanced, however, by its repeated failure to fulfill such a
    task: unable to restrain violence, the artwork literally lets it
    spill out, like a troop of murderous Greek warriors issuing from the
    carved cavity of a wooden horse’s womb” (322). My focus is not only
    on artworks, but on architectural structures, in particular, and how
    they influence the way that we understand Vergil’s epic architexture
    as part of the broader monumental discourse of the Augustan age.

[^247]: I am indebted to Fowler 2000, 193-219, for the illuminating
    discussion thererin of the problems that are just as inherent to the
    idea of the monument in antiquity as they are to the present
    understanding of monumentality in modernity. For further discussion
    of Fowler’s essay see above, pp. 34-36.

[^248]: For a concise survey of this debate see R.D. Williams 1979, 178.

[^249]: See above, pp. 34-36, for more discussion of this aspect of
    Roman monumentality.

[^250]: As the 20<sup>th</sup>-century architectural theorist Christian
    Norberg-Schulz claims, “\[e\]nclosure...determines a space which is
    separated from its surroundings as a particular place. Such spaces
    exist in nature, for instance as caves” (1979, 39).

[^251]: See Bloomer and Moore 1997, 59: “Up and the sky are divine,
    spiritual, ethereal, light, rarefied, spreading, a canopy. Down and
    the earth are material, mineral, dark, compact, firm, a solid, a
    cave.”

[^252]: The French philosopher Michel de Certeau once wrote that in the
    modern age with its structures and “strategies” imposed upon
    humankind it is “\[o\]nly the cave of the home \[that\] remains
    believable, still open for a certain time to legends, still full of
    shadows” (1984, 106).

[^253]: It is interesting to note the way that the cave becomes a symbol
    for the entire cosmos by Late Antiquity. As Demandt 1982, 56, points
    out in regards to the art of Constantine’s reign, “the whole cosmos
    is interpreted as an interior, as the world’s cave, as a *spelunca
    aevi*” (*der ganze Kosmos wird als Innenraum, als Weltenhöhle
    gedeutet, als* spelunca aevi).

[^254]: See Jones 2011 for a discussion of the way that Roman gardens
    also break down the boundaries of the natural and the artificial, as
    well as those of inside and outside. Zanker 1999, 13, discusses how
    the villa gardens at Pompeii “consciously included nature and the
    landscape in their designs to enhance them and add a new dimension
    to the inhabitants’ enjoyment.” See also Bloomer and Moore 1997,
    12-13, for the way that Louis XIV in following the traditions of
    Imperial Rome constructed his massive gardens, “locking nature (by
    implication) in the proud imperial grasp.”

[^255]: Jones 2011, 72.

[^256]: Putnam 1965, 141, defines caves in the *Aeneid* as “place\[s\]
    of suppressed power.”

[^257]: See Hollier 1989, 23, for a discussion of how the writings of
    the French intellectual Georges Bataille also use the image of a
    “cave” that is at once “architectural” and “anti-architectural” to
    show how writing “loosen\[s\] the structure that is hierarchical and
    at the same time creates hierarchy...reopening a hole, remaking a
    hollow, a cave once more.”

[^258]: Bertman 1983, 48-50, details the differences between the two
    figures, suggesting that Vergil crafts his Aeolus in order to
    “prefigure” Aeneas who has yet to appear in the poem.

    αὐλῇ, / ἤματα· νύκτας δ’ αὖτε παρ’ αἰδοίῃσ’ ἀλόχοισιν / εὕδουσ’ ἔν
    τε τάπησι καὶ ἐν τρητοῖσι λέχεσσι. All translations of Homer are
    from Lattimore 1965.

[^260]: As Bertman 1983, 48, puts it, the Homeric Aeolus is presented as
    “dwelling on a free-floating island whose smooth and sheer walls can
    fend off the unwelcome.”

[^261]: Austin 1971, 44, notes *ad loc*. that “Homer does not mention a
    cave; his Aeolus lives richly in a city.” Austin goes on to compare
    this passage with Lucr. 6.189-203, where “the winds are pent in
    clouds like wild beasts.” For the influence of Lucretius on Vergil’s
    Aeolus see also Shea 1977.

[^262]: Hom. *Od*. 10.19-22: δῶκε δέ μ’ ἐκδείρας ἀσκὸν βοὸς ἐννεώροιο, /
    ἔνθα δὲ βυκτάων ἀνέμων κατέδησε κέλευθα· / κεῖνον γὰρ ταμίην ἀνέμων
    ποίησε Κρονίων, / ἠμὲν παυέμεναι ἠδ’ ὀρνύμεν, ὅν κ’ ἐθέλῃσι.

[^263]: Bertman 1983, 48.

[^264]: Pöschl 1950 argues that Aeolus’ role here is analogous to that
    of Augustus in how it is also the charge of the *princeps* to
    contain the fury of the cosmos in the context of a Rome ripped apart
    by civil wars. See also Phillips 1980, 24, claiming that the Aeolus
    episode expresses “the new Augustan order with its stabilizing
    subordination of all things to Caesar, a functioning by which the
    state not only imitated but participated in the divine order.”

[^265]: *OLD* s.v. **3d** “a solid structure built across a stretch of
    water, jetty, mole, dam.” For the unnatural quality of these
    structures in Augustan poetry cf. Hor. *Od*. 2.15.1-2: *iam pauca
    aratro iugera regiae* / *moles relinquent*; 3.29.9-10: *fastidiosam
    desere copiam et* / *molem propinquam nubibus arduis*; Verg. *G.*
    2.161-164: *an memorem portus Lucrinoque addita claustra* / *atque
    indignatum magnis stridoribus aequor,* / *Iulia qua ponto longe
    sonat unda refuso* / *Tyrrhenusque fretis immittitur aestus
    Auernis?* On these passages see also Armstrong 2009, 89-91, and for
    a fuller discussion of how Horace uses the image of extending land
    into the water see above, pp. 63-64.

[^266]: This is not the first time in the poem that the reader has come
    across the word *moles*. Nor is it the last, as we will see
    throughout the first part of this chapter. In the famous line that
    ends the proem of the *Aeneid*, for instance, Vergil asks the
    question: “Was it of such a great effort (*molis*) to found
    (*condere*) the Roman race?” (*tantae molis erat Romanum condere
    erat*, *Aen*. 1.33). Although the word obviously has a different
    meaning here, the operative metaphor is architectural with *condere*
    – used just a few lines earlier to describe Aeneas’ task of founding
    a city in Italy (*multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem /
    inferretque deos Latio*, 1.5-6). And this “effort” is not just that
    of Aeneas, but it is the task of Vergil, as well, as he begins to
    construct his own massive epic poem on that difficult topic. To find
    the word again so soon afterwards, not more than thirty lines,
    suggests an indirect connection between (a poem on) founding Rome
    and the construction of Aeolus’ Cave – which makes the latter’s
    subsequent “failure” all the more ominous. On the parallel nature of
    the difficult tasks that the Trojan hero and the poet must
    accomplish, respectively, see Reitz 2013, 134.

[^267]: *OLD*, s.v. “**1** a portion of time, period, season, event.
    **b** one of a consecutive series of divisions of time, a season, a
    day, an age, etc.”

[^268]: From an anthropological perspective Wilson 1988, 148, makes the
    claim that “\[t\]he ancient monument... assembled together in one
    place the scattered powers of nature.” In the case of Vergil’s
    cosmos, it should be noted, those forces are particularly violent,
    as stressed by Putnam 1965.

[^269]: See above, pp. 20-25, for how the contemporary Roman architect
    Vitruvius draws a similar conclusion for architecture being
    necessary for order of any sort.

[^270]: Wittgenstein 1980, 69, talks of the existence of architecture as
    dependent upon “something” that it can “glorify” and “immortalize”;
    according to the 20<sup>th</sup>-century Austrian philosopher, in fact,
    “there can be no architecture where there is nothing to glorify”
    (*Architektur verewigt und verherrlicht etwas. Darum kann es
    Architektur nicht geben, wo nichts zu verherrlichen ist*). In a
    similar vein one of the most important architects of the 20<sup>th</sup> and
    now 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries, Daniel Libeskind, has recently claimed that
    “all architecture is guided by memory, in forming our sense of
    space, of orientation, and our relationships with one another”
    (2014, 165). The *Aeneid* seems to be suggesting that the converse
    is also true: there can be nothing to glorify and remember without
    architecture.

[^271]: The word *indignantes* is a direct borrowing from the passage of
    Lucretius mentioned above, p. 99, n. 29. Cf. *Aen*. 8.728, where the
    Araxes River – another natural force – is described as *indignitus*
    at the bridge that Augustus has imposed upon it.

[^272]: Austin 1971, 45, *ad loc*., considers this wording to be
    “deliberately ambiguous,” as “it could mean an actual ‘citadel,’
    high above the winds’ dungeon, or the ruler’s headquarters, or
    simply a mountain-peak.”

[^273]: Juno offers Aeolus a wife who will bear him many children. This
    is then a further demonstration of the differences between Vergil’s
    Aeolus and that of his model in Homer who already has a wife and
    twelve children. Bertman 1983, 49-50, n. 5, notes that this passage
    is also adapted from Hom. *Il*. 14.263-269, where Hera bribes Hypnos
    with a nymph, as well.

[^274]: Putnam 1965, 26.

[^275]: Cf. *Aen*. 1.124-156. This passage contains a famous simile that
    suggests an association of Neptune with an Augustus-like politician
    who calms a rabid mob (148-154). Although it is true that Augustus
    did bring a sense of peace and order to Rome, the rebellion of the
    winds at the start of the epic might make one consider just how
    stable that peace really is. If Neptune (or Jupiter) is in control,
    for instance, how should the winds be able to break free at all? And
    are all the Aeolus-like figures who might want to overthrow the
    newly established order in Rome gone for good? It is not hard to
    imagine that those are the types of questions which might still have
    passed through the minds of Vergil’s intended readership in Rome
    when the poem was first published in 18 BCE.

[^276]: See Austin 1971, 114, *ad loc*. Putnam 1965, 16-17, discusses
    the similarity of language and imagery between the imprisonment of
    *Furor* here and that of the winds earlier in Book 1. He also
    connects the equine imagery in both cases with that of the Trojan
    Horse – an object also examined below, pp. 106-115.

[^277]: For further discussion of this passage from Hor. *C*. 3.30 see
    pp. 74-78 above.

[^278]: Cf. *Aen*. 2.32: ***molem** mirantur equi*; 2.150: *quo
    **molem** hanc immanis equi statuere*; 2.185-186: *hanc tamen
    immensam Calchas attollere **molem*** / *roboribus textis caeloque
    educere iussit*. Austin 1966, 42, *ad loc*., notes that *moles*
    “implies not only the bulk of the Horse, but the elaborate work that
    had gone into the building of it.”

[^279]: See Putnam 1965, 6, claiming that there are “three distinct
    metaphors” at work here: \[1\] the horse as a living horse; \[2\]
    the horse as a ship; and \[3\] the horse as a mountain. Putnam’s
    discussion of the similarities in language between the descriptions
    of the Trojan Horse and Aeolus’ Cave (and that of Cacus, as well)
    touches upon many of the same passages as the current analysis. His
    point is to show that Vergil is using similar imagery to emphasize
    the “all-encompassing motif of...violence suppressed and then coming
    to the surface” which is central to the poem in Putnam’s analysis
    (26). My focus is not on violence, *per* se, but the interaction
    between the fragile order brought about through architecture and the
    primordial chaos of Rome’s story that that it is meant to contain.

[^280]: See Austin 1966, 33-34, *ad loc*., where he notes that
    “\[t\]raditionally Athene herself helped to build the Horse or
    advised on its construction,” and cites examples from Homer (*Od.*
    8.493), Euripides (*Tro*. 10. 560-561), and Propertius (3.9.42). The
    Horse can thus be seen as another divinely-made *moles* similar to
    the cave built by Jupiter for Aeolus in Book 1.

[^281]: As Bartsch 1998, 324, puts it, the horse is “filled to teeming
    with the furor of soldiers whom it contains and thus keeps back from
    deeds of violence until it…is breached and opened.”

[^282]: Clausen 1987, 34, claims that “Virgil preserves \[the\]
    ambiguity \[between alive and not alive\] with two nouns, first
    describing the interior of the Horse as *cavernae* then as *uterus*,
    so that attention is drawn equally to its inanimate and animate
    nature.”

[^283]: Cf. *Aen*. 2. 38: *aut terebrare cauas uteri et temptare
    latebras*.

[^284]: See Putnam 1965, 33-34, where he demonstrates how the
    destruction of Priam’s palace in many ways parallels the release of
    the Greeks from the Horse. There are several other disruptions of
    meaning that occur after the Greeks leave the Horse in Book 2 – with
    dire consequences for both sides. For example, when the Trojans take
    up the Greek armor to go into battle in disguise, they first trick
    and kill Androgeos (*Aen*. 2.370-375) before being attacked by their
    own troops who mistake them for Greeks (2.391-395, 409-412).

[^285]: Putnam 1965, 15, also makes note of these verbatim similarities.

[^286]: See Austin 1966, 47, *ad loc*., noting that “Servius explains
    *error* as *dolus,* comparing the *inextricabilis error* of the
    Labyrinth.” As the next chapter will demonstrate, in fact, this
    *error* is an important characteristic of the chaotic forces of
    Vergil’s story of Rome.

[^287]: For further analysis of this passage along similar lines see
    also Putnam 1965, 13-14.

[^288]: These two reasons for its massive size place the Horse in
    obvious opposition to the order of the city: it is a monument made
    to exist outside of city space, as well as the culture that the city
    might contain; to try to include it in one’s city is bound to have
    disastrous consequences. Indeed, the literal downfall of Troy and
    its order is prefigured even before the chaos that the Horse
    contains is released: in order for the *moles* to enter the city the
    Trojans needed to “divide and spread open the walls of the city”
    (cf. *diuidimus muros et moenia pandimus urbis*, *Aen*. 2.234). See
    also Laurence 1996, 119, where in a discussion of the meaning of the
    city in the Roman imagination the scholar claims that “cities were
    part of a human landscape, but their creation and perpetuation was a
    necessary part of the world order, to destroy a city was to bring
    the destroyer into conflict with that order.”

[^289]: Putnam 1965, 14, claims that Laocoon’s action is “futile because
    it is fated neither for him to prove his point successfully nor for
    the horse yet to reveal its armed brood.” The “fatedness” of the
    failure does not detract completely, however, from the fact that the
    priest’s rhetorical strategy fails to achieve the same effect on his
    audience that Sinon gains through an approach that emphasizes the
    monumental surface over any hidden meaning.

[^290]: The subtle suggestion in Laocoon’s speech that the Horse would
    “mount” the city – and the blurring of the artificial and the
    natural implied therein – is made explicit here: “the fateful
    machine mounts the walls, pregnant with weapons” (*scandit fatalis
    machina muros* / *feta armis*, *Aen*. 2.237-238).

[^291]: Cf. *Aen*. 8.217: *uastoque sub antro*; 8.224: *speluncam*.

[^292]: *Aen*. 8.225-227: “…he closed himself within and with the ropes
    cut let loose a massive rock, which was held up with iron and his
    father’s skill, and he fortified the doorposts supported by this
    block” (…*sese inclusit ruptisque immane catenis* / *deiecit saxum,
    ferro quod et arte paterna* / *pendebat, fultosque emuniit obice
    postis*)

[^293]: One obvious etymology for Cacus is the Greek word, κακός,
    meaning “evil.”

[^294]: See Putnam 1965, 131, where he connects the story of Hercules
    and Cacus to the episodes surrounding both Aeolus’ Cave and the
    Trojan Hose as “a further transformation into epic story of the
    figure of *impius Furor*.”

[^295]: Putnam 1965, 133, also notes the importance of *impulit* as a
    way for the poet to strengthen the connection between these various
    episodes.

[^296]: Cf. Verg. *Aen*. 1. 84-86: “They fell upon the sea and together
    both the east wind and the south wind – and with frequent gales the
    southwest wind – overturn everything from the lowermost depths and
    roll immense waves towards the shores” (*incubere mari totumque a
    sedibus imis* / *una Eurusque Notusque ruunt creberque procellis* /
    *Africus et uastos uoluunt ad litora fluctus*). It is not a
    coincidence, it would seem, that Cacus himself is compared to the
    east wind when he tries to run away from Hercules: *fugit ilicet
    ocior Euro* / *speluncamque petit* (*Aen*. 8.223-224).

[^297]: This transformation is anticipated by the poet in the way that
    he (via Evander) uses fire imagery to describe Hercules’ wrath even
    before the hero even enters the cave. At 8.219-220, for instance,
    Hercules’ pain blazes with black gall (cf. *Alcidae furiis exarserat
    atro* / *felle dolor*); at line 230, moreover, he is described as
    “blazing with anger” (*fervidus ira*) because he cannot find a way
    into the cave. Even before his battle with the monster, then, it is
    possible to detect a monstrous change in the hero himself. For more
    discussion of the transformation Hercules undergoes in fighting
    Cacus see also: Doob 1990, 241, where she claims that although
    Hercules serves “a model for Aeneas” in certain respects, the hero’s
    rage “is also a warning” to not “become the monster you destroy”;
    Putnam 1998, 161-162, arguing that “Virgil’s text both confirms the
    similarity \[between Hercules and Aeneas/Augustus\] and complicates
    it by drawing a series of verbal parallels between Hercules and
    Cacus”; and Henry 1989, 170-171, with the suggestion that “\[t\]he
    strength as well as the brutality of Cacus is repeatedly emphasized
    as Virgil prepares the reader for Hercules’ merciless wrath (VIII.
    194-212). \[...\] It is because he must move so close to all these
    threatening nonhuman forces that Hercules runs so fearful a risk of
    madness.” It is important to keep in mind – as Heinze 1903 \[1915\],
    485, n.1, notes – that it was on Vergil’s own initiative that he
    expanded upon the myth and made the battle a “*dramatisch bewegte
    Handlung*” that had previously been a much simpler, non-narrative
    affair.

[^298]: Putnam 1965, 133-134, mentions also the possible etymology of
    Cacus’ name from *caecus* (“blind”).

[^299]: See Clausen 1987, 71-72, claiming that in his depiction of Cacus
    the poet “obviously intended to create an impression of unmitigated
    savagery and horror.”

[^300]: Hercules’ strangling of the monster might also cause a reader to
    remember the way that the monstrous serpents in Book 2 wrap
    themselves around Laocoon and his children (cf.
    *amplexus*...*amplexi*, *Aen*. 2.214, 218) – thus creating one of
    the most pathetic and memorable scenes in the entire poem, as the
    priest of Neptune lifts shouts in vain to the heavens (cf. *Aen*.
    2.220-224).

[^301]: See p. 118-119, n. 65, above. It is also possible to understand
    this episode in a more positive light. Otis 1964 \[1995\], 335-336,
    argues that the account is “an example of the conduct by which man
    can become divine and by which Hercules himself became the true
    predecessor of Aeneas, Romulus and Augustus... \[T\]he Hercules who
    exposes and throttles the fire-breathing monster in his infernal
    lair becomes the symbol of enlightened *vis temperata*.” See also
    Bacon 1986, 331, stating that “\[i\]n Book 8 the transformation of
    chaos into order begins.”

[^302]: Cf. *Aen*. 4.194: “forgetful of their kingdoms” (*regnorum
    immemores*).

[^303]: It is perhaps not coincidental that this shield comes from
    another cave, that is, the Cyclops’ cave on Aetna under the command
    of the fire god, with language that bears some resemblance to the
    description of Cacus’ Cave earlier in the book. Cf. *Aen*.
    8.416-425, 431-432: *insula Sicanium iuxta latus Aeoliamque* /
    *erigitur Liparen fumantibus ardua saxis,* / *quam subter **specus**
    et Cyclopum exesa caminis* / ***antra** Aetnaea tonant, ualidique
    incudibus ictus* / *auditi referunt gemitus, striduntque
    **cauernis*** / *stricturae Chalybum et fornacibus ignis anhelat,* /
    *Volcani domus et Volcania nomine tellus.* / *hoc tunc ignipotens
    caelo descendit ab alto.* / *ferrum exercebant uasto Cyclopes in
    **antro**,* / *Brontesque Steropesque et nudus membra Pyragmon.*
    \[...\] *fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumque metumque* /
    ***miscebant operi flammisque sequacibus iras**.*

[^304]: Nor will he be the last. Aeneas (or rather his armor) will also
    be said to “vomit” flames in Book 10 when his allies spot him
    arriving on a ship: *ardet apex capiti cristisque a uertice flamma*
    / *funditur et **uastos** umbo **uomit** aureus **ignis*** (*Aen*.
    10.270-271). See also Putnam 1998, 160-162, analyzing not only the
    parallel between Cacus and Augustus via the word, *vomere*, but also
    the way that both of their respective door are described by the poet
    as “proud” (cf. *superbis*, 8.196; *superbi*, 8.721).

[^305]: See Doob 1990, 241, noting the connection between Cacus and the
    Shield of Aeneas in their shared generator (Vulcan) and suggesting
    that the common origin of the two from the fire god “undercut\[s\]”
    the seemingly “optimistic image” of the Shield. Putnam 1998, 162,
    argues in a similar vein that the “connection between Cacus and
    Aeneas’ armor...forces us to ask what might be the common ground
    between Vulcan’s monster son and the god’s artifact, what might be
    intellectually skewed about the iconic shield itself and about the
    tremendous vision it projects.”

[^306]: Cf. Pliny, *NH* 36.19.84: “We should also speak of labyrinths,
    that is, the most awe-inspiring work of human expenditure, but not
    think them fictions, as one might suppose they are” (*dicamus et
    labyrinthos, vel portentosissimum humani inpendii opus, sed non, ut
    existimari potest, falsum*). Doob 1990, 17-36 (“Chapter 1: The
    Literary Witness”), presents a collection of ancient sources that
    express a sense of wonder at labyrinths, including Herodotus,
    Diodorus Siculus, and Varro, in addition to Pliny the Elder. Morris
    1992, 190, claims that in Greek the term λαβύρινθος eventually came
    to signify “parts of Greek monumental architecture, according to the
    building accounts from Hellenistic Didyma, which refer to an element
    called λαβύρινθος, in the context of more technical terms for parts
    of the temple.”

[^307]: Varro describes the difficulty of escaping such labyrinths in
    discussing the tomb of Lars Porsenna (= Pliny, *NH* 36.19.91): “He
    was buried under the city of Clusium, in which place he has left a
    monument of rectangular masonry, each side being three hundred feet
    wide, and fifty feet high, and within the square of the foundation
    is an inextricable labyrinth, out of which no one who enters it
    without a mass of thread can ever discover an exit” (*Sepultus sub
    urbe Clusio, in quo loco monimentum reliquit lapide quadrato
    quadratum, singula latera pedum tricenum, alta quinquagenum, in qua
    basi quadrata intus labyrinthum inextricabile, quo si quis
    introierit sine glomere lini, exitum invenire nequeat*). But see
    Rawson 1985, 191, cautioning that “\[w\]e do not know Varro’s
    context; it might not have been wholly serious.”

[^308]: Doob 1990, 1. See also McEwan 1993, 60, claiming similarly that
    “the Labyrinth, it is essential to realize, appears under two very
    different and seemingly self-contradictory guises,” and Choay 2001,
    175, arguing that “the labyrinth is the human edifice par
    excellence, the one most capable of channeling duration and
    compelling space to defer its necessary deployment toward meaning,
    the one most capable of leading to human alterity; the most
    redoubtable too, as it can both trap or liberate, and as its
    creative powers cannot be experienced without the unrestricted
    involvement of mind and body together.”

[^309]: Galileo once famously said that the universe “is written in the
    language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles,
    and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible
    to understand a single word of it; without these one is wandering
    about in a dark labyrinth” (as quoted in Saiber 2005, 18).

[^310]: See Benjamin 1982, 647: “*Nicht im Irrgang verfällt ihr der
    Mensch sondern er unterliegt dem monotonem, faszinierend sich
    abrollenden Asphaltband. Die Synthese dieser beiden Schrecken aber,
    den monotonen Irrgang, stellet das Labyrinth dar*.” For discussion
    of this passage see Vidler 2000, 240, where he claims that for
    Benjamin “the modern experience was, as Nietzsche had already
    proposed, ‘labyrinthine’; not clear and transparent like the
    Heideggerian temple, but obscure and ambiguous as to both its figure
    and its ground.” See also Choay 2001, 178, where the scholar also
    uses the idea of the labyrinth as an allegory for where she claims
    we are at the start of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century in terms of our
    understanding of our past: “As represented by a labyrinth, hidden
    under the beguiling surface of a mirror, our built heritage and the
    conservative practices attached to it may be construed as an
    allegory of man’s situation at the dawn of the twenty-first century:
    uncertain of the direction in which science and technics are leading
    him, seeking a path on which they might liberate him from space and
    time in order to be differently and more creatively immersed in
    them.”

[^311]: Jencks 1977 \[1981\], 124, makes the argument that
    “Post-Modernists complicate and fragment their planes with screens,
    non-recurrent motifs, ambiguities and jokes to suspend our normal
    sense of duration and extent.” Jencks goes on to compare this kind
    of ambiguous space to that of a Chinese garden which “crystallizes a
    ‘liminal’ or in-between space that mediates between pairs of
    antinomies, the Land of the Immortals and the world of society being
    the most obvious mediation. It suspends normal categories of time
    and space, social and rational categories which are built up in
    everyday architecture and behavior, to become ‘irrational’ or quite
    literally impossible to figure out.”

[^312]: Eco 1984, 2. Eco’s use of the metaphor here originates from Eco
    1979, 9, in which he details the reader’s role in working though the
    “maze-like structure of the text.” For Eco, at least, this maze
    *does* have a limited amount of meanings, since “\[y\]ou cannot use
    the text as you want, but only as the text wants you to use it. An
    open text, however ‘open’ it be, cannot afford whatever
    interpretations.”

[^313]: Barthes 1964, 27:*“impossible de le fuir,* parce qu’il veut tout
    dire.” I address in more detail and contextualize Barthes’ take on
    the idea of the monument below, pp. 197-198.

[^314]: Hollier 1989, 58, claims that “\[t\]he labyrinth is basically
    the space where oppositions disintegrate and grow complicated, where
    diacritical couples are unbalanced and perverted, etc., where the
    system upon which linguistic function is based disintegrates, but
    somehow disintegrates by itself, having jammed its own works.” See
    also Tschumi 1990, 29, where the “deconstructivist” architect
    suggests that “one’s perception is only part of the labyrinth as it
    manifests itself. One can never see it in totality, nor can one
    express it” (as cited in Shanks and Pearson 2001, 126).

[^315]: See Doob 1990, 227-253 (“Chapter 8: Virgil’s *Aeneid*).
    According to Doob, in fact, “the idea of the labyrinth constitutes a
    major if sometimes covert thread in the elaborate *textus* of the
    *Aeneid*, providing structural pattern and thematic leitmotif”
    (228).

[^316]: See Doob 1990, 28: “The comparison of the *lusus Troiae* to the
    labyrinth is based on the fact that both are complex in pattern,
    difficult to follow, and interwoven. \[...\] The comparison of game
    to labyrinth is apt, then, because of the artistic complexity they
    share.” There might even be a connection between the idea of the
    labyrinth and that of dance. Frontisi-Ducroux 1975, 147, connects
    the Cretan labyrinth, for example, to the crane dance ritual on
    Delos as *tout naturellement* related in that they both not only
    have the same inventor in the figure of Daedalus, but also in that
    the dance “appears as a new repetition of the same pattern, already
    expressed by two figures: that of a path defined by a building
    \[i.e., the labyrinth\] and that of one defined by a spiral drop”
    (*apparaît comme une nouvelle répétition du même schéma, déjà
    exprime par deux figures: celle d’un trajet délimité par une
    construction et celle d’une spirale se déroulant*).

[^317]: See p. 124, n. 74, above.

[^318]: For Doob 1990, 31, these words serve as “oblique glances at the
    negative face of the Cretan maze.” Frontisi-Ducroux 1975, 143,
    argues that the labyrinth of Daedalus is indeed an “\[e\]nigmatic
    place, barely material…far from presenting itself as a building
    \[it\] appears mainly as the spatial expression of the concept of
    *aporia*, of an insoluble problem, of a particularly perilous
    situation” (\[*l*\]*ieu énigmatique, à peine matériel, le Labyrinthe
    de Dédale, loin de se présenter comme un bâtiment, apparaît surtout
    comme l’expression spatiale de la notion d’aporie, de problème
    insolluble, de situation particulièrement périlleuse*).

[^319]: P. A. Miller 1995 also sees the *Lusus Troiae* as a “strategy of
    containment.” However, Miller’s reading of the labyrinth presents it
    as “symbolic” (in the Lacanian sense) of “the attempt to domesticate
    the chaotic powers associated with passion and the feminine” (228).
    Indeed, for Miller, “\[t\]he labyrinth as the symbolic functions as
    a mechanism of repression, which makes a controlled, socially
    sanctioned desire possible” (234) and represents “those patriarchal
    strategies of containment that try to shut out the other, both from
    within and without” (240). See also Habinek 2005, 254-256, where he
    picks up on the symbolic nature of the labyrinth as “feminine,” in
    that “\[t\]he knowledge acquired by the journey into and return from
    the labyrinth…is also knowledge of the innards of the body, whether
    construed as entrails or female sexual organs or both.” (254). It is
    interesting to note in the context of this passage, moreover, that
    the idea of the labyrinth as “imposing order on chaos” might be a
    particularly Roman idea. See McEwan 1993, 60, who argues that
    “\[t\]he Western tradition has been to interpret the skillful
    embrace of *aporia* revealed through the construction of...\[the\]
    Labyrinth as a question of imposing order on chaos. This is a
    misrepresentation whose roots may well lie with the Romans.”

[^320]: Cf. *Aen*. 5.604-663.

[^321]: The labyrinth’s function would be similar, then, to the many
    pseudo-Troys in Book 3 that distract Aeneas and his followers from
    their mission and prolong their *errores*. See Quint 1982, 34,
    arguing that “\[w\]ith its parade of replica Troys – each
    successively and more explicitly revealed to be a place of death –
    the fiction of Book 3 has emphasized the Trojans’ need to escape
    their past and its memories.”

[^322]: For bibliography on the origins of the *Lusus Troiae*, see Doob
    1990, 27, n. 15. Kern 1981 suggests that the games served either as
    a rite that was performed at the founding of cities or as an
    initiation rite for young boys into manhood. P. A. Miller 1995, 234,
    agrees with this interpretation, suggesting that the event functions
    as “a ritual of manhood and purification that readies adolescent
    boys for the serious work of defending their city”; according to
    Miller, however, the game’s “conscious symbolic force...is
    undergirded by a deeper, pre-rational evocation of the necessity of
    containing desire.”

[^323]: See Syme 1939, 445, and Doob 1990, 27.

[^325]: Although Doob 1990, 235-236, claims that this event “looks both
    ways” with a “characteristic labyrinthine duality,” her main point
    is to contrast this event to the later mention of the labyrinth in
    Book 6, arguing that in the case of the former the “the dangers of
    the maze are tamed, and indeed Romanized, as *errores* define the
    artistic pattern within which *labores* joyously imitate the works
    of war and peace-making which constitute Rome’s art.” The above
    analysis has shown that the dangers of the labyrinth are not in fact
    “tamed” here. See also P. A. Miller 1995, 232, interpreting the
    games as “represent\[ing\] a masculine strategy of containment
    directed against a feared and dangerous desire that is symbolically
    represented as feminine, but that...exists within us all.”

[^326]: Fitzgerald 1984, 60, claims that “\[f\]ar from being absorbed
    into the *error* that is the labyrinth, the Trojans themselves
    create it and weave the past into tradition.” See also Otis 1964
    \[1995\], 284, where he identifies the labyrinth as symbolizing “the
    labyrinthine past and its hidden contents.”

[^327]: Hollier 1989, 60, frames the inability to control the meaning of
    a labyrinth well when he claims that “\[t\]he labyrinth does not
    hold still, but because of its unbounded nature breaks open lexical
    prisons, prevents any word from finding a resting place ever, from
    resting in some arrested meaning, forces them into metamorphoses
    where their meaning is lost, or at least put at risk. It introduces
    the action of schizogenesis into lexical space, multiplying meanings
    by inverting and splitting them: it makes words drunk.”

[^328]: Fitzgerald 1984, 54, states that one of the “distinguishing
    features” of the description is that “possibly for the first time in
    ancient literature an artistic work is described in which the artist
    represents his own story.” Putnam 1998, 5, is in agreement with
    Fitzgerald – and even goes so far as to claim (with more certainty)
    that this work of art “documents the only instance in ancient
    literature where an artist tells his own tale solipsistically in
    art, appropriating his own creativity for a final burst of
    inspiration.”

[^329]: See below, pp. 139-142.

[^330]: *OLD*, s.v. **1b**.

[^331]: See Putnam 2001, 180, arguing that “we do hear of the labyrinth,
    the ‘toil’ and the ‘deceit’ of its house, incapable of being
    disentangled. But disentangle is exactly what Daedalus does,
    unraveling the intricacy of his art now because of Ariadne’s love,
    which he pities.”

[^332]: Fitzgerald 1984, 55, argues suggestively that the “temple frieze
    *is* a labyrinth” – one “whose balanced symmetry baffles the eye
    that would trace a narrative line through its contents.”

[^333]: See Bartsch, 1998, 328, maintaining that the *Aeneid* uses the
    labyrinth (and other “labyrinthine artworks”) as a symbol for the
    complexity of its own meaning.

[^334]: Cf. *Aen*. 6.33-37: “He would have no doubt scanned all of it
    with his eyes had not Achates, who was already sent ahead, then
    arrived and with him the priestess of Apollo and Diana, Diephobe,
    daughter of Glaucus, who said the following to the king: ‘This time
    does not lend itself to such spectacles.’” (*quin protinus omnia* /
    *perlegerent oculis, ni iam praemissus Achates* / *adforet atque una
    Phoebi Triuiaeque sacerdos, */ *Deiphobe Glauci, fatur quae talia
    regi:* / *‘non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula poscit*’). See also
    Henry 1989, 141-142, for the “particular importance” these events
    might have had for Aeneas, and Casali 1995, 1-9, for a speculative
    hypothesis regarding what Aeneas might have seen if he had continued
    to examine the doors.
