subtitle: Roman Monumentality and the Modern Death(s) of the Monument
---

The Augustan age provides a particularly useful lens through which to
examine the idea of the monument. It represented a relatively short
period of time in which Romans witnessed the monumental make-over of
their city, their government, and even what it meant to be Roman.
Building was on the minds of many Romans during Augustus’ reign. The
poets and writers of the period are famous for constru(ct)ing their
works as buildings or monuments of some sort. Livy and Horace have their
own *monumenta*. Vergil his *templum*. Ovid has his *opus*. Might
Augustus have thought of his work in Rome in such architectural terms?
…*rei publicae constituendae*…[^475] That was the task that Augustus
took up when he first came into power. He did not do it alone, though.
There were also the Augustan poets who contributed to his
monumentalization of Rome with their own *monumenta* – poets who helped
Romans to become better readers of the structures around them, both
physical and metaphorical.

To conclude this dissertation I will now turn to the situation of the
monument in modernity. By outlining some of the ways that the idea of
the monument has been viewed in modern times I hope demonstrate by way
of contrast just how productive the Roman understanding of monumentality
was in Augustan Rome. The below rather concise history of monumentality
in modernity is not the only story that one could tell about the idea of
the monument in the 18<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries. It is a cursory review,
not a comprehensive study, and several important players and moments in
the debate simply had to be left out for the sake of concision. My aim
in looking now at more recent times is rather to demonstrate how the
concept of monumentality in the Augustan age was a fruitful response to
some of the same issues which we deal with today when we think of the
structures around us – both in our physical reality and in the way they
help us to frame how we see the world in which we live.

“The Death of the Monument.” With this bold title Lewis Mumford famously
announced the fall of monumental architecture in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.
What was the cause of its demise? Death by “contradiction.” That was
Mumford’s initial diagnosis, at least.[^476] The idea of the monument –
an object “oriented toward death and fixity” – simply did not fit any
conception of modern architecture, which for Mumford stressed “life and
change.”[^477] The very stone materials that had so long been endowed
with “a metaphysical belief in fixity and immortality” now became
dangerous “encumbrances” in Mumford’s eyes: monumental structures
“stifle the possibilities of adaptation, movement and effective
improvement” – and for that reason, Mumford warned, they might even
bring about civilization’s “ultimate downfall.”[^478]

This was not the first time that the death knell had sounded for the
monument. Nor would it be the last. The monument had died and would
continue to “die” in modern thought – whether as a symbol of past
traditions, as a physical structure erected to represent present powers,
or as a metaphor operative in giving structure to the ways in which we
think about thinking. This conclusion will examine three “deaths” of the
modern monument in particular, each time with an eye to the different
conclusions of this dissertation regarding the idea of the monument in
Augustan Rome. Although the Romans faced some of the same issues with
the nature of the monument, especially in regards to its physical and
epistemological instability, this study has suggested that these
anxieties did not lead to the collapse of the idea but rather its
reconstruction – and with it the reconstruction of Roman society after
years of civil strife and political disillusionment.

###Part 1. The First “Death”: Demolishing the Structures of the Past###

“Let there be no mistake,” Victor Hugo wrote in his *Notre-Dame de
Paris* (1831), “architecture is dead.”[^479] The culprit this time?
Gutenburg’s printing press, according to Hugo, which had given everyone
the ability to build (metaphorically) his or her own grand edifice of
knowledge that the church and palace had once represented.[^480] As a
result, it has been argued, grand architecture began to lose the
symbolic authority that it had possessed when it was closely bound to
the ideas of the sacred and the royal before finally dying with the fall
of the *Ancien Régime* and the questioning of all the power structures
that it had represented.[^481]

The French Revolution had also stripped monuments of the ability to make
material the binding structure of past authority. Indeed, while Henri
Léonard Jean Baptiste Bertin (1720-1792) as Louis XV’s *contrôleur
général des finances* wrote to his king that “\[t\]he history and public
law of a nation are based on its monuments,”[^482] the aftermath of
French Revolution with its wish to produce a radical break from the
structures of the past produced a rather different attitude towards
monuments: the past that grand architecture commemorated was a lost (and
undesirable) past;[^483] it was rather the new needs of the present and
future that monuments should address.[^484] And while there were
certainly attempts by those like the English art critic, John Ruskin, to
save the monuments of the past and the authority they could
materialize,[^485] the ancient structures that did exist came to be seen
with a more questioning eye by historians, even once the strong desire
for “rupture” from the past had subsided.[^486] To Fustel de Coulanges
at the end of the nineteenth century, for example, it was the “document”
– and specifically *not* the “monument”– that became our tie to the
“truth” of the past.[^487]

Already in the nineteenth century, then, it is possible to detect a
version of what Mumford would call a “distrust for the monumental”[^488]
– not only in the inability of monuments to produce the same kind of awe
that they once had done for the church and traditions of the past, but
also in the failure of these structure to create for humanity a stable
link to that past. The collapse of the power structures of church and
state revealed what seemed to be a flaw in the nature of the monument,
namely, its inability to endure once the link between it and the
figurative structure of the state had been severed. Structures fade away
over time. And those structures that had once been symbols of power were
now symbols of that very power’s collapse.

The Romans at the beginning of the Augustan age did not abandon the
structures of their past, whether real or figurative; they rebuilt them,
rather, despite the narrative of the Roman state’s “collapse” at the end
of the republic, as voiced in authors such as Livy and Horace.[^489]
These new structures were built upon past foundations, so to speak, but
used the stability offered by monumentality to balance innovations
against the previous structures of Rome’s history. Horace did this with
his *Odes* by constructing a poetic *monumentum* that was lyric but also
incorporated forces that might seem to upset its generic framework. In
this way, as I argued in Chapter III, the poet crafted a work whose
generic tensions allowed for a constantly dynamic structure that was at
once traditional and innovative – one that would breathe new life into
an old structure. Augustus in his *Res Gestae* also employed a similar
rhetorical strategy in describing his own building activities to
articulate the novel kind of power that he had fashioned for himself
without destabilizing the traditional boundaries of Rome’s political and
cultural past. It was just as much in downplaying the radical nature of
his works as in stressing their magnificence that allowed the emperor to
incorporate new ideas and structures within traditional republican
boundaries without seeming to break them down even further. Neither
Horace nor Augustus shied away from employing the power of monuments –
and the idea of a dynamic structure that they provide – even at a time
when the old monuments of Rome that represented the *res publica* were
in ruin. In short, both the poet and the *princeps* saw the advantages
to employing such structures of the past, if only because it allowed
them to articulate delicately the innovations which they made to those
structures’ traditional frames.

###Part 2. The Second “Death”: Shaking the Foundations of Present Authority###

Let us return briefly now to Mumford and his autopsy of the monument’s
“corpse.” A closer look at his essay reveals that modernism was not the
sole cause of death. “\[E\]very stone has become ironic to us,” Mumford
noted. “\[T\]ime is a bomb that will split the most august temple open,
if the wanton savagery of men’s swifter bombs does not anticipate
time.”[^490] Faith in present monuments still did exist for the moment,
though, as the ability to create secular monuments fell to the people of
the French Revolution and its aftermath. However, the doubt that had
adhered to monuments of the past eventually – and in a certain sense
inevitably – also began to enter into people’s thoughts concerning
monuments of their present, as well as those of their future. In the
aftermath of one World War and at the cusp of yet another there was a
certain awareness of the fragility of mankind’s affairs and structures.
And this “distrust for the monumental,” as Mumford put it, would only
increase following WWII when the atrocities of that war produced
monuments that “stopped celebrating great deeds, as their specialty
\[was\] to register grave errors.”[^491]

A transformation of the monumental to commemorate what one might wish
had never happened was not the only blow to the West’s faith in
monumentality that WWII delivered. The grand building projects of
Mussolini and Hitler each left their own impact on the idea of the
monument. The desire of *Il Duce* to remake Rome “vast, ordered,
powerful, as it was in the time of the first empire of Augustus,” had
led to several monumental building projects in Rome that integrated or
directly called upon Roman monuments in an attempt to capitalize on the
imperial monumentality of the Augustan age itself.[^492] There was the
dangerous belief among Mussolini’s followers, moreover, that these
projects legitimated his plans for domination of the
Mediterranean.[^493] The Italian art historian Gustavo Giovannini would
go so far as to proclaim that “\[w\]hile the Empire returns to the fated
hills of Rome and new glories join themselves with the ancient ones,
from our hearts comes the vow that architecture of the Fascist times
will resume – in the return to our grand tradition – the path of
domination which was that of the past.”[^494]

Yet this was all relatively tame compared to the vast (and utterly
intrusive) building programs that Hitler was planning in Northern
Europe.[^495] To reclaim the monuments and monumentality of imperial
Rome for his own use was not so easy a task in Germany as it was for
Mussolini in Rome. Hitler’s strategy had to be different. As the famous
German architectural theorist Léon Krier would later say, Hitler sought
not merely to “copy historic styles, but to create a new style which was
itself to become historical” – one that far surpassed the “coarse
Latinism of Italian Fascism.”[^496] The goal was not imitation of Roman
monumental architecture, *per se*, but of its high degree of sheer
monumentality.[^497] “\[I\]t was gigantic proportions,” then, and “not
purity of style, that interested Hitler.”[^498] More importantly,
though, it was an obsession with using his buildings to create a message
that would – according to his chief architect Albert Speer – “deliver
his time and its spirit to posterity.”[^499]

It would have no doubt been enough to make people wary of monuments if
Mussolini and Hitler had succeeded in their architectural
endeavors.[^500] The fact that they failed, however, that their
buildings and building projects came to be judged as “colossal
mistakes,”[^501] would create a further distrust in the idea of the
monument by reinforcing the emptiness, fragility, and instability of the
meaning of monuments both ancient and modern. Just consider, for
instance, whether there could ever be another Lincoln Memorial in
America, or another face added to Mt. Rushmore. No matter how great a
president might be, I would argue, the very idea of erecting such a
monument to him or her has become almost inconceivable today.

As Chapters IV and V demonstrated, however, the “failure” of a monument
to maintain a single, triumphant narrative can be just as useful as its
success for making a viewer think about the past and its relation to him
or her. Vergil again and again show the inability of monuments, whether
old or new, to serve as epistemological ballasts. However, the ability
of a monument to have multiple meanings does not necessarily render it
any less useful – whether for the poet or Augustus himself. For the
Augustan peace to have its full significance, I argued above, it was
necessary for Romans to see beyond the monumental frame of their city to
the chaotic past that existed beneath the marble facade. *Furor* had
been bound and chained by Augustus, it is true, but that did mean it was
gone forever. And Augustus needed his subjects to remember that, too.
Vergil helps to craft readers who can appreciate the beauty and
magnificence of the surface of Augustan monuments while remembering the
violent and chaotic past that such monuments try to frame and contain.
Far from “deconstructing” the positive message of a monumental structure
both Vergil and Augustus used the epistemological “failure” of monuments
to establish an even deeper appreciation of the new and improved present
within the Roman imagination.

###Part 3. The Third “Death”: The Collapse of the Monumental Metaphor###

The idea of the monument was first killed in modernity when the
loosening of authority that the printing press had set in motion began
to shatter the power structures of the past (as well as the monuments
that materialized them) in the revolutionary air of the late eighteenth
century. It was at this time, however, that the idea of monument was
reborn as a monumentality geared to the present and future – only to die
again, though, when its stability (physical and epistemological) was
revealed to be a farce by the World Wars that shook humanity to its
foundations.[^502] It was not long afterwards that Roland Barthes would
write in his important essay on *La Tour Eiffel* (1964) that the famous
French edifice was an “empty monument” (*monument vide*) – one that was
“impossible to escape, *because it means everything”* and yet also
“*nothing*” in that “it achieves a kind of zero degree of the
monument.”[^503] Such a point had been reached, in other words, when the
physical monument which had once been the chief symbol of humanity for
representing authority past and present was now a representation of the
problems with representing any idea – including not least of all
representation itself.

The possibility of an “empty” monument that Barthes raised has
additional significance for the discussion of modern monumentality. The
monument was not just an important signifier for the traditions of the
past and power structures of the present; it had been from the start
perhaps one of the fundamental metaphors for “thinking about thinking”
in the West.[^504] The above narrative regarding the “death” of physical
monuments runs parallel to another history concerning the demise of
metaphorical ones in the context of (the aptly named) post-structuralism
and, in particular, the theories and practices of deconstruction.

Majestic architecture had always been – in the words of Hugo – the
“grand book of humanity.”[^505] A strange thing happened, though, when
the physical monument began to lose its power as the Ur-symbol, as
discussed above with its first two “deaths.”[^506] If anything, in fact,
losing its physical nature seems to have allowed the architectural
monument to gain additional power as a metaphor. Just at the point when
architecture ceased to be the universal text of humanity in Hugo’s text,
for instance, text became humanity’s universal architecture.[^507]

Hugo was not alone in carrying the discourse surrounding architecture
and monuments into the text. Kant had already erected his famous
“edifice of metaphysics” in the *Kritik der Urteilskraft* near the very
start of the French Revolution in 1790.[^508] As this transformation
continued, moreover, the removal of the monument from history (and
historiography) proved harder than Fustel de Coulanges and others would
have liked. Nietzsche would claim that we need a sense of the
“monumental” in our history – despite its many dangers[^509] – if we are
to learn anything at all from the past and not be severed from it
entirely.[^510] Foucault writing over a hundred years afterwards might
have put it best, though, when he noted that whereas history used to
turn monuments into documents the opposite had occurred in his own time:
historians now make documents into monuments.[^511] It had become clear,
in other words, that documents of the past are in essence fashioned just
like monuments – and thereby are open to the same dangers of
interpretation.[^512] It might not be a coincidence, then, that it was
in this particular intellectual milieu in which Barthes and Foucault
were writing – when the monument had died, lost the power of its
materiality, and been reborn in the text – that post-structuralism came
to prominence.

The monument would “die” once again in this context, of course. The
executioner this time would be none other than the theories and
practices of deconstruction. The transformation of the monument from a
physical building in reality into a metaphorical one in the text had
left the latter vulnerable to the same instabilities that had been noted
in the former. Kant’s worst anxieties thus came to fruition: the
foundations of his edifice of metaphysics were seen to be just as
susceptible to failure as any real building – and with their cracking
would come “the collapse of the whole structure.”[^513] Indeed, as the
Japanese cultural critic Kojin Karatani would put it, the desire of Kant
(and much Western philosophy) “‘to construct a solid edifice’ ultimately
does not achieve a foundation, but reveals instead the very absence of
its own foundation.”[^514] Western thought cannot but undermine itself,
according to Karatani, as the very will “to establish order and
structure within a chaotic and manifold becoming” betrays the fact that
the order is not only constructed, but also subject to collapsing back
into the chaos it masks.[^515] It would seem, in fact, that this third
death of the monument – that is, the collapse of the grand metaphorical
edifice of Western philosophy which was supposed to provide stability
and fixity for all thought – was perhaps not an insignificant factor for
the strength of deconstructive discourse itself over the past few
decades.

This modern response is one way to come to grips with the
acknowledgement that monuments are inherently unstable, as physical
structures and as metaphors. But what if one decided to embrace fully
the malleability of meaning inherent to the structural metaphor of a
monument? What if one used that same instability to enlist one’s
audience in validating and stabilizing that new structure whatever it
may be? Would that not allow one to erect something that can transcend
the traditional boundaries that limit one’s potential to create
something new and innovative? Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* perhaps gives us an
answer to these sorts of questions. The very lack of structure in his
architextural monument allows him at the end of his text to craft a poem
that achieves its power not by establishing a solid edifice; the power
of the *Metamorphoses* lies rather in the way that it asks its audience
to establish firmly the open and ever-changing nature of the work. It
was by these means, as Chapter VI suggested, that Ovid could make his
private self a permanent part of the public consciousness and transcend
the physical limits of his body – all while also helping to shape
through his poem how the Roman public understood what it now meant to be
Roman in a new age. Augustus’ monumentalization of Rome represented a
similar response to the opening up of boundaries that his reign had
produced: the *princeps* at the end of his *Res Gestae* broke down and
reconstructed the republican boundaries of private and public in such a
way that he too could have his subjects themselves become partners in
establishing a new frame for structuring Rome and Roman identity.
Neither poet nor *princeps* might have been quite so successful, though,
if each had not embraced the inherent epistemological instability of
architectural discourse when articulating how they had reshaped Roman
space and through it Roman identity. They were not afraid to let their
audiences give the final meaning to their monuments; in fact, that very
well may have been the secret to their subsequent immortality.

\*\*\*

“Remember the impression of good architecture, that it expresses a
thought,” Ludwig Wittgenstein once wrote. “You want to respond to it
with a gesture.”[^516] Augustus might have opened up the dialogue by
making Rome a city of marble. He needed people who could “respond” to
him, however, especially since the meaning of his monumental structures
and their relation to what it meant to be Roman was often far from
unambiguous. Nor could they be otherwise when the *princeps* had to be
careful to establish his new Rome upon what Rome had been – both in good
times and bad. The Augustan poets in turn investigated the monumentality
of their age through their own monumental poems. This dissertation has
suggested that their *monumenta* entered into a dialogue with the
monumentalization of their city, shaping it and being shaped by it. They
not only built monuments that would last even longer than that of the
*princeps*; more than that, the self-reflective nature of their
monuments made explicit the assumptions of the dialogue itself – and
thus opened it up as a dialogue in which any Roman reader could
critically engage.

What about those readers? The Roman people themselves played an
essential part in responding to the architectural gestures of the
*princeps* and thereby giving meaning to the structures of their
existence. And in closing this dissertation I want to look at *this*
dialogue in the context of one final architextural passage – this time
from Augustus himself. In an edict recorded by Suetonius, the *princeps*
claimed:

> Ita mihi **salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere in sua sede** liceat
> atque eius rei fructum percipere, quem peto, ut **optimi status auctor
> dicar** et moriens ut feram mecum spem, **mansura in vestigio suo
> fundamenta rei p. quae iecero**. (*Div*. *Aug*. 28.2)[^517]
>
> May it thus be permitted for me **to establish in its place the *res
> publica* securely and soundly**, and to reap from that action the
> fruit that I seek, on the condition that **I may be called** **the
> architect of the best state**, and that when I die I may carry with me
> the hope that **the foundations of the *res publica* which I have set
> will remain in its position**.

Suetonius adds that Augustus “himself granted his own wish by striving
in every way that there be no dissatisfaction with the new state”
(*fecitque ipse se compotem voti nisus omni modo, ne quem novi status
paeniteret*, *Div. Aug*. 28.2). Although Suetonius might be right here
about the political situation, his interpretation completely misses the
importance of the architectural metaphors at play in Augustus’ statement
(cf. *salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere* *in sua sede … mansura in
vestigio suo fundamenta rei p. quae iecero*). Architectural meaning
cannot be established by a top-down approach – neither in the case of
physical buildings nor with the structure of the *res publica* itself.
Augustus seems to have understood that notion better than the average
leader, whether in antiquity or today. And it was in allowing the Roman
people to be a part of the dialogue that monumental architecture opens
up – whether in stone or in word – that was just as important to making
sure he would in fact be called the “architect of the best state”
(*optimi status auctor dicar*) by his subjects.[^518] For it was by
leaving it to the Romans themselves to validate the new *status* that
the *princeps* could ensure his monument of the city itself (and what it
now meant) would remain standing in place long after he had died.

It was much to Augustus’ advantage, then, that there were contemporary
poets whose self-reflective *monumenta* could provide lessons in the
nature of monumentality. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid each brought out
different aspects of monumentality, its weaknesses as well as its
strengths, with the understanding that monuments were structures which
were inherently (and paradoxically) both stable and unstable,
epistemologically and much as physically. This was not a harsh critique
of what Augustus was doing in reality. Nor was it merely a game, either,
that paralleled a loss of faith in the meaning of structures that had
framed Roman existence in the aftermath of the republic’s supposed
“collapse.” It was rather in part because of these poets that the Roman
people could fully understand why the monumental *constitutio* that
Augustus had built was the best that Rome had ever seen – and, even more
importantly, that it ultimately could not stand for very long without
their consent.

[^476]: Mumford 1937, 264: “The very notion of a modern monument is a
    contradiction in terms: if it is a monument, it cannot be modern,
    and if it is modern, it cannot be a monument.”

[^477]: Mumford 1937, 264. The original Mission Statement for the
    Metropolitan Kansas City Performing Arts Center (now known as the
    Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts) is an excellent
    illustration of this change in the way that we think about grand
    architecture. It reads: “Great architecture is not the goal. Iconic
    reference is not the goal. The goal of any world-class
    performing-arts centre today must be the enhancement of the
    experience for the artist, for the audience, and, finally, for the
    myriad of services necessary before great performances can happen in
    the modern age: everything from administrative offices to parking
    spaces” (as cited in Hammond 2006).

[^479]: Hugo 1831: “*Qu’on ne s’y trompe pas, l’architecture est
    morte*.” This quotation comes from a chapter of Hugo’s *Notre-Dame
    de Paris*, “This \[i.e., Text\] Will Kill That \[i.e.,
    Architecture\]” (*Ceci tuera cela*), which is perhaps one of the
    most sensitive appraisals of the relationship of architecture and
    text ever written. I want to thank Prof. Michèle Hannoosh in the
    Department of Romance Languages and Literature at the University of
    Michigan for directing my attention to this work in conversation.

[^480]: See Hugo 1831: “The grand poem, the grand edifice, the grand
    work of humanity will be built no longer, it will be printed.
    \[...\] Every mind is a mason. The humblest fills his hole or lays
    down his stone.” (*Le grand poème, le grand édifice, le grand œuvre
    de l’humanité ne se bâtira plus, il s’imprimera*. \[...\] *Chaque
    esprit est maçon. Le plus humble bouche son trou ou met sa pierre*.)
    One could say that Hugo was extraordinarily prescient considering
    that he was writing over a century before the advent of the
    internet, blogs, and social network engines such as Facebook with
    its “walls.” See also Choay 2001, 8, claiming that “\[t\]he memorial
    hegemony of the monument was not... threatened until printing gave
    to writing an unprecedented power in the matter.”

[^481]: See Bloomer and Moore 1977, 17, where they suggest that
    “\[a\]rchitecture had benefited from an embodied and memorable
    legacy when it was centered around a sacred model, but with the
    Enlightenment a great many new models evolved; palaces and churches
    had to compete for architectural eminence with a range of secular
    building types.” Crossley 1998, 175, discusses the structure of the
    medieval church as the embodiment of “moral education,” as well as
    “the internal and ordered theatre for the workings of the intellect,
    the memory or the soul.” See also Olsen 1986, 289, arguing that
    monumentality had survived the new “religion” of capitalism (which
    should have looked down on excessive expenditures) precisely because
    “\[w\]hat had once been the peculiar privilege of the spiritual and
    secular masters of society became a universal indulgence.” This
    evolution of the monumental was also noted in Marx and Engels 1848
    when the two political theorists famously wrote in Chapter 1 of the
    *Communist Manifesto* that the bourgeoisie of their time were “the
    first to demonstrate what human activity can bring about” in
    accomplishing “marvels wholly different from Egyptian pyramids,
    Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals. (*Die
    Bourgeoisie...\[e\]rst..hat bewiesen, was die Tätigkeit der Menschen
    zustande bringen kann. Sie hat ganz andere Wunderwerke vollbracht
    als ägyptische Pyramiden, römische Wasserleitungen und gotische
    Kathedralen...*)

    storia e il diritto pubblico di una nazione si basano sui
    monumenti*.”

[^483]: See Morley 2011, 220: “\[M\]onumental history...depends on the
    assumption that there is a direct connection of some kind between
    these different temporalities.” A “fundamental break in this
    tradition” can be achieved, according to Morley, when that
    assumption is called into question by “the development of a sense of
    a rupture between past and present.” Bataille 1970, 171, goes so far
    in fact as to claim that it is hard to understand the taking of the
    Bastille as motivated by something other than “the hatred of the
    people for the monuments which are their real masters” (*l’animosité
    du peuple contre les monuments qui sont ses véritable maîtres*).

[^484]: See Choay 2001, 8: “‘Monument’ would \[after the French
    Revolution\] denote power, greatness, beauty: it was explicitly
    charged with affirming grand public schemes, promoting styles, and
    addressing itself to aesthetic sensibility.” Choay’s book presents
    an in-depth account of the process whereby monuments in France and
    elsewhere went from being “commemorative” to what she calls
    “historical,” as well as the consequences of that transformation for
    their role in society today.

[^485]: See Ruskin 1849, 155, where he impassionedly claimed that “the
    greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, nor in its gold.
    Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of
    stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or
    condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by
    the passing waves of humanity.” Ruskin was famously against any sort
    of intervention in one’s experience of monuments of the past; for
    him, even restoration was to be viewed with contempt. It is
    important to note, however, that Ruskin should be seen as reacting
    to the changes of his time more than necessarily a representative
    figure of them more generally.

[^486]: Nora 2001, xiii: “Historical time of the revolutionary type is
    informed by the desire for rupture. The devaluation of the notion of
    rupture that accompanied the decline of the revolutionary idea
    restored legitimacy to the idea of tradition. Not a tradition of
    which we would be the heirs and sustainers (as in the revolutionary
    mode), but a tradition from which we would be forever separated, one
    that would thereby become precious, mysterious, and imbued with an
    uncertain meaning, which was our task to recover.”

[^487]: See Le Goff 1978, 38, where he discusses how Fustel de Coulanges
    in his *La monarchie franque* (1888) criticized the German tradition
    of historiography based on monuments – exemplified in the *Germania
    Monumenta historica* (1828) – as written “not with the seal of
    science, but with that of patriotism” (translated by Le Goff as:
    “*non dal sigillo della scienza, ma da quello del patriottismo*”).

[^489]: Cf. Liv. Pr.9; Hor. *C*. 3.6.1-4. For analysis of these passages
    see pp. 40-41. Gruen 1974 is right to emphasize that this idea of
    “collapse” was perhaps created in hindsight by later authors. It is
    precisely that narrative of authors such as Livy and Horace which I
    am analyzing, however, and not the historical validity of such a
    “collapse.”

[^490]: Mumford 1937, 264.

[^491]: Carpo 2007, 54. Meyers 2012, 13, notes in a similar vein that a
    “crisis point for modern European architects occurred after World
    War II, as they sought appropriate expression for the melancholy
    relationship of war trauma and history.” See also Young 2000 for the
    impact of the Holocaust on the idea of the monument. As Roxani
    Marconi claims in her introduction to the 2000 exhibition on
    “Counter-Monuments and Memory” at MoMA, “\[i\]n an era that
    resonates with the aftereffects of World War II, the Vietnam War,
    and the removal of the Berlin Wall, the need to recollect has
    intensified. Yet, paradoxically, the capacity of traditional
    monuments to preserve memories proves ever more precarious”
    (http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2000/openends/open\_ends.html).
    I would like to thank Prof. Christopher Ratté, the Director of the
    Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan, for recommending I
    examine this exhibition, as it proved inspirational for some of the
    key concepts in this dissertation.

[^492]: This quote comes from a speech delivered by Mussolini on New
    Year’s Eve 1925, as cited in Kostof 1978, 323, n.18: “*vasta,
    ordinata, potente, come fu ai tempi del primo impero di Augusto*.”
    See also Scobie 1990, 1-2, claiming that “Mussolini turned the
    monuments of Augustan Rome into political symbols partly to validate
    his own role as the founder of a new Roman empire and partly to
    rekindle a new spirit of ‘heroism’ in the Italian people. \[...\]
    Absolute power was now revealed unambiguously in absolute
    architecture, which provided the emperor and his successors with a
    stage set for intimidating rituals of encounter between mortal
    subjects and their divine ruler.” Edwards 1996, 51-52, also provides
    a brief overview of some of Mussolini’s projects in Rome and the way
    they employed Roman ruins.

[^493]: See Millon 1965, 53, where he argues that “historians of art and
    architecture in Italy in the late 1930s directly aided the Fascist
    regime by advocating an expansionist policy based on the scholarly
    evidence they were able to gather concerning the extent of Italic or
    Latin (both words were used interchangeably) control, power, and
    influence from antiquity to the rise of the Fascist regime.”

[^494]: From the *Atti del 1° congresso nazionale di storia
    dell’architettura* (1938)*,* as cited in Millon 1965, 55-56, n. 10:
    “*Mentre che l’Impero ritorno sui colli fatali di Roma e le glorie
    nuove si ricongiungono con le antiche, parte dai nostri animi il
    voto che l’Architettura del tempo fascista riprenda, nel ritorno
    alla grande nostra tradizione, il cammino di domino che ebbero
    quelle del passato*.”

[^495]: As Demandt 1982, 59, notes, Hitler also “thought of himself as
    architect” (*sich selbst als Architekt empfand*) – and saw building
    as an important part of his cultural program. Indeed, according to
    Scobie 1990, 37, one of the messages of Hitler’s *Mein Kampf* was
    “that industrialized German cities of his own day lacked dominating
    public monuments and a central focus for community life.” As Scobie
    goes on to show, moreover, Hitler would address this “problem” in a
    rather significant way in several German towns and cities by
    building his own monuments – without much concern, of course, for
    whatever older buildings were in his way.

[^496]: Krier 1985, 226, as cited in Scobie 1990, 16.

[^497]: See Demandt 1982, 59, where he suggests that “Hitler took
    Classicism as the way to monumentality” (*Hitler...schätzte am
    Klassizismus die Möglichkeit zur Monumentalität*).

[^498]: Scobie 1990, 19.

[^499]: See Speer 1969, 68, as cited in Scobie 1990, 94: “*Hitler liebte
    zu erklaren, dass er baue, um seine Zeit und ihren Geist der
    Nachwelt zu überlieferen*.”

[^500]: North 1985, 18, claims that “\[t\]he public monument has
    succumbed to the modern habit of equating the public with the false,
    the meretricious, the propagandistic.” This “modern habit,” I would
    suggest, has a large part to do with the Fascist and Nazi
    architecture discussed above.

[^501]: Most notably, the Piazzale Augosto Imperiale, at least according
    to how Kostof 1978, 322, evaluates the structure. See also Reitz
    2013, 215-229, on the construction of Mussolini’s obelisk and its
    obviously forced sense of *Romanità*. In the case of Hitler’s
    monumental failures of architecture, as Speer quipped in a 1977
    interview, while “\[t\]he Romans built arches of triumph to
    celebrate the big victories won by the Roman empire...Hitler built
    them to celebrate victories he had not yet won” (Dal Co and Polano
    1978, 43, as cited in Scobie 1990, 133-134). See also Scobie, 1990,
    136, where he cautiously suggests that “Hitler’s architecture is
    sometimes misjudged because he was building for the future in
    anticipation of a greatly enlarged Reich.”

[^502]: Or live on, according to Choay 2001, 171, in a form that serves
    solely as a “patrimonial mirror,” presenting us with an “illusion”
    of reality by “eras\[ing\] all its differences, heterogeneities, and
    fractures...\[and\] suppress\[ing\] the conflicts and interrogations
    we are unable to face.” See also Smithson 1966, 11, claiming that
    “\[i\]nstead of causing us to remember the past like the old
    monuments, the new monuments seem to cause us to forget the future,”
    and Carpo 2007, 54, where the scholar argues that “\[m\]onuments can
    no longer point to the future because the postmodern construction of
    history does not provide one, or it provides too many. Historical
    monuments have no place in posthistorical times.” This way of
    thought regarding the future finds a major proponent with Nora 1989,
    17, where the French historian maintains that “\[s\]ince no one
    knows what the past will be made of next, anxiety turns everything
    into a trace, a possible indication, a hint of history that
    contaminates the innocence of all things.” Nora sees this problem,
    in other words, as resulting in the birth of a new kind of monument,
    *les lieux de memoire*, which are “fundamentally remains, the
    ultimate embodiments of a memorial consciousness that has barely
    survived in a historical age that calls out for memory because it
    has abandoned it” (12).

[^503]: See Barthes 1964, 27, 33: “*Ce signe pur – vide, presque – il
    est impossible de le fuir,* parce qu’il veut tout dire. \[...\]
    \[*E*\]*n fait la Tour n’est* rien, *elle accomplit une sorte de
    degré zéro du monument*...”

[^504]: See Karatani 1995, xxxi-xxxii, claiming that “Platonic
    architecture is metaphorical. Plato’s use of the metaphor of
    architecture, like that of Descartes, Kant, and Hegel who followed
    him should thus be understood as the will to construct an edifice of
    knowledge on a solid formulation. \[...\] Philosophy, in fact, is
    another name for this *will to architecture*.”

[^505]: Hugo 1831, 142: “*En effet, depuis l’origine des choses jusqu’au
    quinzième siècle de l’ère chrétienne inclusivement, l’architecture
    est* *le* *grand livre de l’humanité*.” Later in the same work Hugo
    also refers to grand architecture as having been “*la grande
    écriture du genre humain*” (144), “*l’écriture principale,
    l’écriture universelle*” (146), and “*le registre principal de
    l’humanité*” (147).

[^506]: As Nora 1997, ix, puts it, the “Land, Cathedral, and the Court”
    were once *the* “models of models.”

[^507]: See Hugo 1831, 152: “We must admire and always examine the book
    written by architecture, but we must not deny the grandeur of the
    edifice which printing in turn has erected.” (*Il faut admirer et
    refeuilleter sans cesse le livre écrit par l’architecture; mais il
    ne faut pas nier la grandeur de l’édifice qu’élève à son tour
    l’imprimerie*). Hugo’s narrator does not suggest that architecture
    has won anything from this transformation; it is clear, however, in
    the language he uses to speak of text here (and elsewhere towards
    the end of the chapter) that such a transformation has in fact
    occurred – and, more importantly, that architecture has been reborn
    as a metaphor in a form that is just as or even more potent. Indeed,
    the very idea that grand architecture has died entirely is perhaps
    negated by the fact that Hugo is writing a book that is called the
    *Notre-Dame de Paris*, after all.

[^508]: See Kant 1790 \[1799\], 6: “Then, if such a system under the
    general name of Metaphysics should come to stand someday...the
    critique of it must have previously explored the base of this
    edifice to the deepest foundation of the properties of its
    principles independent of experience, so that it not in some part
    sink and thus inevitably draw with it the collapse of the entire
    structure.” (*Denn, wenn ein solches System unter dem allgemeinen
    Namen der **Metaphysik** einmal zu Stande kommen soll...so muß die
    Kritik den Boden zu diesem **Gebäude** vorher so tief, als die erste
    Grundlage des Vermögens von der Erfahrung unabhängiger Prinzipien
    liegt, erforscht haben, damit es nicht an irgend einem Teile sinke,
    welches den Einsturz des Ganzen unvermeidlich nach sich ziehen
    würde*. Translation adapted from Meredith 1911.) Kierkegaard
    1836-1846 \[2008\], 2.279, also adopts the metaphor of grand
    architecture in his critique of some philosophers when he says that
    “\[m\]ost systematizers in relation to their systems are like a man
    who builds an enormous castle and himself lives alongside it in a
    shed.”

[^509]: See Nietzsche 1874 \[1893\], where in Chapter 2 of his “On The
    Use and Abuse of History for Life” (*Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der
    Historie für das Leben*) he claims that “monumental history deceives
    by analogies with seductive similarities: it excites the brave to
    rashness, the enthusiastic to fanaticism” (*monumentale Historie
    täuscht durch Analogien: sie reizt mit verführerischen Ähnlichkeiten
    den Mutigen zur Verwegenheit, den Begeisterten zum Fanatismus*).

[^510]: See Nietzsche 1874 \[1893\], maintaining in Chapter 3 of the
    same work that “should one’s past be considered critically, then one
    can take a knife to its roots, and we proceed beyond all reverence.
    It is always a dangerous process, namely, one hazardous for life
    itself: and people or times that serve life in such a way that they
    judge and destroy their past are always dangerous and vulnerable
    people and times. For since we are now the results of earlier
    generations, we are also the results of their aberrations, passions,
    and errors – even their crimes; it is not possible to loosen oneself
    entirely from this chain” (*wird seine Vergangenheit kritisch
    betrachtet, dann greift man mit dem Messer an seine Wurzeln dann
    schreitet man grausam über alle Pietäten hinweg. Es ist immer ein
    gefährlicher, nämlich für das Leben selbst gefährlicher Prozeß: und
    Menschen oder Zeiten, die auf diese Weise dem Leben dienen, daß sie
    eine Vergangenheit richten und vernichten, sind immer gefährliche
    und gefährdete Menschen und Zeiten. Denn da wir nun einmal die
    Resultate früherer Geschlechter sind, sind wir auch die Resultate
    ihrer Verirrungen, Leidenschaften und Irrtümer, ja Verbrechen; es
    ist nicht möglich, sich ganz von dieser Kette zu lösen*).

[^511]: Foucault 1969, 14-15: “Let us say to be brief that history, in
    its traditional form, sought to ‘remember’ the *monuments* of the
    past, to transform them into *documents,* and to make speak those
    traces that, in themselves, are often not verbal, or that say in
    silence something other than what they say; in our time, history is
    that which transforms *documents* into *monuments*” (*Disons pour
    fair bref que l’histoire, dans sa forme traditionnelle, entreprenait
    de “mémoriser” les* monuments *du passé, de les transformer en*
    documents *et de faire parler ces traces qui, par elles-mêmes,
    souvent ne sont point verbales, ou disent en silence autre chose que
    ce qu’elles disent; de nos jours, l’histoire, c’est ce qui
    transforme les* documents *en* monuments”). Foucault was preceded
    indirectly in this line of thought by Riegl 1903, where the Austrian
    art historian claims that when we use the word “monument” to refer
    to something as “historical” evidence “it is not by virtue of their
    original purpose that the sense and meaning of monument come to
    these works, but rather we as modern subjects who label them such”
    (*nicht den Werken selbst kraft ihrer ursprünglichen Bestimmung
    kommt Sinn und Bedeutung von Denkmalen zu, sondern wir moderne
    Subjekte sind es, die ihnen dieselben unterlegen*, 7). See also Le
    Goff 1978, 43: “The document is a monument. It is the result of the
    effort made by the historical societies to impose on the future –
    like it or not – that given picture of themselves.” (*Il documento è
    monumento. È il risultato dello sforzo compiuto dalle società
    storiche per imporre al futuro – volenti o nolenti – quella data
    immagine di se stesse*).

[^512]: Le Goff 1978 provides a concise narrative of this evolution from
    monument to document and then back to monument. See also Morley 2011
    for an examination of Nietzsche and Foucault’s use of
    “monumentality” and, in general, the “constant possibility \[of
    monumentality\] in all historiography” that historians need to
    acknowledge even as they deny its presence (226).

[^513]: See p. 199, n. 34, above.

[^514]: Karatani 1995, 8. See also Wigley 1993, 7, arguing that
    “metaphysics is no more than the attempt to locate the ground” – a
    “ground” which does not exist, *per se*, but arises from the
    assumption of philosophy that there is something under its
    foundations. This line of thought – as Wigley 1993, 39, points out –
    has its roots in Heidegger’s 1953 work *Introduction to Metaphysics*
    (*Einführung in die Metaphysik*), where the German philosopher
    “raises the possibility that the ground (*Grund*) might actually be
    a concealed ‘abyss’ (*Abgrund*) and that metaphysics is constructed
    in ignorance of, or rather, to ignore, the instability of the
    terrain on which it is erected, such that ‘we move about over this
    ground as over a flimsily covered abyss.’”

    Architektur, daß sie einen Gedanken ausdruckt. Man möchte auch ihr
    mit einer Geste folgen*. For more discussion of Wittgenstein and his
    thoughts on architecture see above, p. 33, n. 57, as well as p. 102,
    n. 38.

[^517]: The Latin text of Suetonius is from Ihm 1907.

[^518]: *OLD*, s.v. *auctor*: “**14** The founder (of a city, etc.),
    builder (of an empire).” The architectural imagery throughout the
    brief edict suggests a translation of the often difficult translate
    *auctor* as “architect” or “builder.”
