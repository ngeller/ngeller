subtitle: Ovid, Augustus, and the Transcendence of Structure
---

Horace stabilizes his architextural *monumentum* by keeping opposites in
perfect tension through rhetorical disavowals. Vergil destabilizes the
boundaries of his, on the other hand, by exposing what horrors of Rome’s
past seek to escape through the cracks in his epic facade. The
*princeps* employed both strategies when constructing a new Rome within
the Roman imagination; it was perhaps even imperative for him to do so
if he was to be successful in introducing new elements to Rome’s
traditional structure while at the same time keeping alive the memory of
Rome’s rough recent history in the cultural consciousness. Although
Augustus claimed to keep intact the traditional “structures” of Rome, it
was in these very same claims – or rather rhetorical refusals – that he
could perhaps best articulate the novel power he had acquired. At the
same time, however, Augustus was also in charge of creating a new
“structure” to reframe Roman existence after the “collapse” of the
republic.[^393] And for Romans to appreciate fully Augustus’ marble city
as a monument built upon Rome’s past foundations the *princeps* also
required citizens who could see beneath the city’s newly resplendent
surface to the ruin and chaos of its history that could just as easily
return if completely forgotten. Augustus’ ability to perform this
balancing act throughout his reign was thus an important part of
reconstructing a Roman state that would last. And this dissertation has
argued that in his *Res Gestae* Augustus relied on the discourse of
monumentality – like the poets of his age with their *monumenta* – in
order to frame his reconstruction of Rome in the imagination of his new
subjects just as much as in its physical landscape.

By the end of the Augustan age, however, different issues arose as the
once stable boundaries which had structured Roman existence in the
republic were in large part replaced by new ones under Augustus. The
political system was different. Augustus had powers above and beyond
what any single Roman before him had amassed. The city was different,
too. It had undergone a transformation that was unlike anything that its
inhabitants had witnessed before. It was a time of transition to
something new, a time of flexibility and flux.[^394] Not surprisingly,
the architexture of late Augustan poetry reflects this state of affairs.
The *Metamorphoses* of Ovid in particular demonstrates yet another
important element of the success that the *princeps* achieved. Ovid does
not seek to stabilize or destabilize his architextural structure, as
Horace and Vergil did, respectively; rather, as I argue below, the late
Augustan poet transcends the very idea of structure in such a way that
he can enable his Roman readers to become participants in endowing his
structure-less monument with meaning.[^395]

The present chapter will examine Ovid’s poem with particular attention
to this seemingly paradoxical idea of a structure that resists the idea
of structure. Part 1 will analyze the poem’s structural “frame”[^396] –
its difficult proem and much-debated epilogue – in order to understand
better the way that the monument of the *Metamorphoses* attempts to
transcend structure, as well as what implications that has for the Roman
reader. This close analysis of Ovid’s transcendent poetics will set the
stage for one last return to Augustus’ *Res Gestae* in Part 2 to see how
the *princeps* performs his own transcendence of structure in assuming a
comprehensive control over Roman space at the end of his own monumental
work.

###Part 1. Ovid’s Transcendent Poetics###

Horace’s collection of *Odes* is a work of lyric poetry. Vergil’s
*Aeneid* is an epic. They may negotiate their places within these two
genres, as Chapters III-V have shown, but both poets at least have a
clear architextural model to work with/against as they present their
poems architecturally. The situation is different when it comes to
Ovid’s *Metamorphoses*. The genre of the poem has long been debated
among scholars. To some it is “an uncategorizable multiform prodigy” –
one that purposefully defies generic classification through an extreme
mixture of genres and modes.[^397] Others acknowledge epic as the “point
of reference for generic conflict,” seeking then to evaluate just how
epic the *Metamorphoses* really is.[^398]

The point of the present analysis will not be to provide a comprehensive
study on the poem’s complex meaning. Nor will it so much aim to solve
the debate about genre as to change its parameters, that is, to look
through the poem’s architexture to ask why the *Metamorphoses* is so
difficult to define in the first place. Ovid is not so much
“deconstructing” the idea genre, *per se*,[^399] as he is staging the
transcendence of structure itself in order to keep himself and his poem
continually alive in the imagination of his readers. He leaves his
structure “open,” in other words, so that it becomes dependent upon his
readers themselves to give it a final sort of definition and establish
its ultimate meaning in relation to their Roman reality.[^400]

Before examining the architextural “structure” that Ovid claims to have
built in his famous epilogue at the end of Book 15, it is important to
understand the context in which he constructs it. And it is perhaps at
the beginning of the poem that Ovid as the narrator most clearly sets
the boundaries of his scope, generic and otherwise, even if those same
boundaries hardly appear stable from the very start.

> In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas\
> corpora; di, coeptis (nam uos mutastis et illa)\
> adspirate meis primaque ab origine mundi\
> ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen. (Ov. *Met*. 1.1-4)[^401]
>
> My mind urges me to speak of forms changed into new bodies. Inspire my
> undertakings, gods (for you have changed those, too), and spin a
> continuous song from the very origin of the world up to my own times.

Much has been written about these four lines and their importance to the
poem.[^402] Transformations from the beginning of the world to Ovid’s
present are the topic of the *Metamorphoses*. That much is certain. The
more one looks at the proem, though, the less clear its meaning becomes.
The past is Ovid’s frame, yes, but the first two words of the poem – *in
nova* – point towards something new, as scholars have stressed.[^403]
And which past is it anyway? A historical one? Or one largely concerned
with myth?[^404] Or both? Transformation is the focus, obviously, but
what kind of transformation? Although the more typical way of stating
such a theme would be to say that the poem will examine bodies changing
their shapes, it has been noted that Ovid rather peculiarly says he will
sing of the shapes themselves (*formae*) changing into new bodies (*in
nova…* / *corpora*, 1-2).[^405] Then there is the question of genre,
with particular focus on the frustrating “generic paradox” implied in
the juxtaposition of *deducite* and *perpetuum*…*carmen* in line
4.[^406] Whereas the former is an elegiac word, used by Vergil,
Propertius, and Horace to describe their respective songs,[^407] the
latter is an “unmistakable” allusion to the kind of grand epic that
Callimachus in his elegiac *Aetia* does not write.[^408] On one side of
the debate, scholars have stressed epic as the base upon which Ovid is
innovating. According to Stephen Hinds, for instance, “the meter, bulk
and scope of the poem ensure that the question implied in that opening
paradox \[i.e., of *deducite* and *perpetuum Carmen*\] will never be
completely eclipsed: namely, in what sense is the *Metamorphoses* an
epic.”[^409] Even if the general appearance of the poem seems epic,
however, the first line of the proem has already informed the reader
that appearances (*formae*) are not stable.[^410] Joseph Farrell has
argued, on the other side of the spectrum, that we should see the
different genres and modes of the poem as part of a “dialogue,” that is,
as individual “ingredients of \[Ovid’s\] *carmen perpetuum*,” which
undermines any set authority, narrative or generic.[^411] From this
viewpoint, then, epic is just one of several different modes that Ovid
is weaving together like “a chain of iridescent tales out of one or more
pre-existing texts, using material from different genres.”[^412]
Regardless of the particular side of the debate that one falls on,
however, there is one notion with which most would agree: all of these
subtle reversals within the relatively brief opening to the poem point
to the many different ways that Ovid has purposefully fashioned “the
proem to the *Metamorphoses* to arouse, and then defeat the expectations
of the reader.”[^413]

This immediate frustration of expectation at several different levels
should not be entirely unexpected, though, given that change is the very
topic of the poem itself. Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* proclaims from the
start that change is and has always been happening, a sort of “endless
flux” in the cosmos,[^414] all the way “from the very origin of the
world up to \[his own\] times” (*primaque ab origine mundi* / *ad nostra
tempora*, 3-4).[^415] One might then say that the base assumption of the
proem is that change is the only constant – even for Ovid’s own
undertakings themselves (cf. *nam uos mutastis et illa*, 2). Yet that is
an assumption which cannot but prompt reflections upon the nature of
change itself. For if change is truly a constant, then logically even
the parameters by which we evaluate change must themselves change.[^416]
And sure enough, as scholars have noted, the proem of the
*Metamorphoses* serves as a perfect foundation for the rest of a poem
whose very hermeneutical boundaries are constantly changing – a “poetics
of flux,” as Stephen Wheeler puts it.[^417]

“The whole *Metamorphoses* is built around precisely the crossing of
boundaries,” Don Fowler writes, “but it presupposes that those
boundaries are there to be crossed.”[^418] The proem helps to make that
tension explicit: in a world of constant change the short opening of the
*Metamorphoses* introduces the idea of a generic structure without a
stable framework – one whose boundaries indeed seem to be established
only to be transgressed. The *Metamorphoses* is a poem, after all, whose
narrative is itself in a constant state of flux: stories cross over the
“boundaries” of the poem’s books,[^419] or are often embedded within
others stories,[^420] as narrators narrate the tales of other
narrators.[^421] It is no coincidence, then, that the “boundaries” of
the poem’s primary architextural image examined below are much less
stable than even those in Vergil’s *Aeneid*. The epilogue of the
*Metamorphoses* not only reveals how Ovid’s “monument” is emblematic of
a poem without a stable generic structure; more importantly, the poem’s
concluding architextural image helps to illustrate how the poet
transcends the very idea of structure inherent to monuments in order to
reshape the boundaries of the real world, as well as his place in
it.[^422]

*Iamque opus exegi*. “And now I have completed my work.” With these
words Ovid begins the epilogue to his poem of roughly 12,000 lines. This
is not exactly a traditionally epic ending to a poem that might seem
epic to judge by its length.[^423] That should not necessarily be a
surprise, though, given the poem’s generic puzzles as presented in the
proem. Although Ovid is also in dialogue with Vergil’s *Aeneid*
here,[^424] these three opening words are clearly alluding to Horace’s
*exegi monumentum*, that is, the phrase which begins the finale to
Horace’s first collection of *Odes* examined above in Chapter III.[^425]
It is in the differences between how the two poets envision the
architexture of their respective works, however, that one can best
appreciate the striking nature of what Ovid is attempting to do in what
is considered by many as a sort of personal *sphragis*,[^426] or “seal,”
for his lengthy poem:

> Iamque opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira nec ignis\
> nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere uetustas.\
> cum uolet, illa dies, quae nil nisi corporis huius\
> ius habet, incerti spatium mihi finiat aeui:\
> parte tamen meliore mei super alta perennis               875\
> astra ferar, nomenque erit indelebile nostrum;\
> quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris\
> ore legar populi, perque omnia saecula fama\
> (si quid habent ueri uatum praesagia) uiuam. (Ov. *Met*. 15.871-879)
>
> And now I have completed a work, which neither the wrath of Jove nor
> fire nor a sword nor decaying old age will be able to efface. May that
> day which has power over nothing except this body of mine end the
> uncertain span of my life when it wants to end it. I will forever be
> carried by the better part of me above the lofty stars, and my name
> will be indelible; wherever Roman power spreads in lands subdued, I
> will be read by the mouths of the people, and because of my fame
> through all the centuries (if the prophecies of bards have any truth)
> I shall live.

Even if Ovid is adopting the *exegi* of Horace (*C*. 3.30.1), he calls
his work an *opus* as opposed to Horace’s *monumentum*. Tony Woodman
sees this as a flaw in Ovid’s exposition, since the poet “does not
specify what he imagines his immortal construction to be, *opus* being a
weak word commonly used of any literary composition.”[^427] According to
Bronwen Wickkiser, on the other hand, *opus* actually “reinforces the
architectural metaphor” that is more explicit in Horace’s *monumentum*;
in fact, drawing upon the works of Vitruvius and Ovid himself, Wickkiser
argues that “*opus* refers especially to works of public architecture,”
such as monuments.[^428] Both scholars are right to a degree. The image
does have an architectural valence – both in its own right and by virtue
of its connection to the Horatian intertext – though it may not be as
strong as Wickkiser suggests. For one, as Wickkiser herself points out,
“\[t\]he word *opus* occurs many times throughout the *Metamorphoses*,
and often in reference to non-architectural works of art, such as the
weavings of Minerva (6.82) and Arachne (6.14, 102, 130) and Pygmalion’s
statue (10.249, 254).”[^429] There is a bit of ambiguity, in other
words, in the term *opus* within Ovid’s own work with respect to what
kind of image is evoked. And it is not an insignificant choice on the
part of the poet to avoid an unambiguously architectural image. Woodman
is certainly correct, after all, that Ovid’s image does lack the
specificity of Horace’s very architectural and physical *monumentum* –
and he justly prompts us to ask what exactly Ovid is envisioning here.
For instance, would the sturdy monument of Horace be disturbed in the
slightest by a mere “sword” (*ferrum*)?[^430] Probably not. However,
even though Woodman (somewhat pejoratively) calls Ovid’s *opus* an
“imagistic fragmentation” for these very reasons,[^431] the fluid nature
of the poem as discussed above suggests that perhaps “imagistic
fragmentation” is *exactly* what Ovid is trying to achieve.

Joseph Solodow in his monograph on the complexities of narration in the
*Metamorphoses* presents an argument that takes a more moderate path
between Woodman and Wickkiser in redeeming Ovid’s lack of specificity in
the *sphragis* of the poem. While Solodow agrees with Woodman both that
Ovid “presents a more abstract notion” than Horace with the word *opus*
and that the threats to his imagined work (i.e., the lightning bolt, the
sword, time) “evoke no one particular image,”[^432] the former scholar
sees this “fragmentation” not as a flaw but rather as part of Ovid’s
“triumph” over Horace; for Solodow, in fact, “Ovid’s claim is grander”
than that of his predecessor, even if it is less “epic.”[^433] His
reasoning here has to do with the notion that Ovid’s *opus* is “in every
point more private.”[^434] Unlike Horace’ account – whose massive
*monumentum* is “objective, nearly impersonal,” striving for a sort of
epic grandeur despite its lyric mode – Ovid’s accomplishment “originates
in him, its sphere is himself, the glory that results will be his
alone.”[^435] Ovid wants his readers to see him as an artist, according
to Solodow, and his final words help establish the poet as the sole
creator of the world inside his poem.[^436]

Solodow is right to see the abstract image of Ovid’s *opus* as symbolic
for a poem that “strives for visible clarity and for the public and
permanent qualities of a monument…\[a\]nd yet at the same time…remains a
feat of triumphant subjectivity.”[^437] And there is something more
“private” about Ovid’s apparent farewell than Horace’s grander and more
solemn send-off. It would seem, however, that Solodow goes too far in
claiming that “\[n\]either the poet nor his poem claims to speak for
anything larger than the individual, not divinity or national life, not
history or society.”[^438] In contrast to this view, Wickkiser is not
incorrect to stress the importance of the historical – and, in
particular, architectural – context in which Ovid was writing. Although
Ovid’s architextural image might be more difficult to determine, as
Woodman suggests, and his tone perhaps more subjective and personal, as
Solodow is right to point out, the poet is still working within the
architectural discourse of his age. It is in fact the very idea of
structure inherent to monumentality which Ovid is aiming to transcend
while simultaneously also employing it.[^439]

This is perhaps not a simple idea to grasp. How one can both use and
abuse the metaphor of structure at the same time? Let us start unpacking
this concept by looking first at the poet himself and the relationship
he has with his monument. For one, it is not Ovid’s *monumentum* that
will defy time and space, as Horace’s did, so much as the poet
himself[^440] – albeit not in his current mortal form. Time has control
over Ovid’s body, yes, but nothing more than that: *dies, quae nil nisi
corporis huius* / *ius habet* (874-875). Time also has the ability to
“end the space of \[his\] life” (*spatium mihi finiat aevi*, 875). Yet
Ovid will not be bound by a physical space anymore, either, as he will
be carried not just *to* the stars, but all the way *beyond* them (cf.
*super…astra ferar*, 875-876).[^441] Chapter II demonstrated the way in
which monuments have the ability to make past time and space
present.[^442] One could argue that Ovid here is calling to mind the
very time and space that monuments help to manifest only to transcend
them as the material version of the poet himself disappears and a
version of his self is kept alive “forever” (cf. *perennis*, 875) in the
imagination of the Roman people. In order to transcend structure, after
all, one needs to have a structure to transcend – and it is precisely
this which the idea of the monument provides for Ovid here.

It is not just that Ovid transcends structure, however, but the precise
way in which he does that is so essential to understanding the broader
implications of his work for the world outside it. Ovid might be more
“private” in his send-off, as Solodow suggests, but he has made that
“private” part of him a public object through his poem, as well. Indeed,
as Ovid himself claims, his “better part” (*parte meliore*, 875) will no
longer be just his own. Every Roman citizen wherever Roman power has
spread (cf. *quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris*, 877) will
contribute to making Ovid’s prophecy of immortality (cf. *vivam*, 879)
come true precisely because the poet will now be read by all Romans (cf.
*ore legar populi*, 878). Even if Ovid’s body (*corporis*, 874) might
die and rot and disintegrate, the Romans themselves will nevertheless
ensure that his name becomes indestructible (cf. *nomenque erit
indelebile nostrum*, 876). Ovid’s poem is his own. The *sphragis* makes
that clear. It is through a transition into the public realm, though,
that poem and poet can achieve a sort of immortality that is granted to
an existence without firm physical boundaries of time and space.

Yet this transcendence is about more than mere “textual survival.”[^443]
If the conclusion to the poem shows how the private has become public in
Ovid’s world, the poem itself also shows conversely how the public has
become private. The poet is telling not only his own story in the
*Metamorphoses*, as Horace does for the most part in his *Odes*; Ovid is
relating, rather, all the changes that have ever happened from the
beginning of the world to his own time in leading to Rome’s current
position as a world power – which is an extension, backwards and
forwards, of even what Vergil had done in his epic poem in telling only
of Rome’s origins.[^444] More lyric than lyric, more epic than epic,
Ovid’s claim for comprehensiveness means that anything and anyone that
exists or has existed in the Roman world – mythical and historical – is
subject to his reinterpretation in the world of his poem.[^445] It is
not simply, then, that the Romans will make Ovid eternal. By authorizing
the poet and his world through the act of reading itself the poem’s
audience also brings into being a distinctive sense of what it means to
be Roman – one which is defined by Ovid’s worldview,[^446] that is, one
which is without firm bounds, one which “lies open” (*patet*,
877).[^447] They can thus establish their common public identity by
reading the monument that Ovid erects despite – or rather *because of* –
the fact that they themselves give it a final structure and meaning by
reading and interpreting the poem.

By crafting his poem as a monument whose seemingly epic structure is
transcended in his ambiguous architextural image at its conclusion Ovid
can therefore leave his poem “open” for the reader to give it shape. Is
it epic? Is it something else? If the former, can I even trust it? And
ultimately what does it mean to me and my place in Roman history? Ovid’s
*monumentum* has a monumentality of the highest degree, perhaps, because
it continuously prompts its readers to question the very significance of
the history that it tells – that is, their own history – which thereby
forces them to come to terms with it.[^448] And by thus giving a final
shape to the poem and its author they have granted Ovid access to the
public consciousness in such a way as to shape (as he has so much else
in his poem) how his readers see their constantly changing world and
their place in it.

This sort of tension in a text between being at once left “open” by the
author and “closed” by the reader was famously worked out by the
twentieth-century semiotician Umberto Eco in his influential essay on
“The Poetics of the Open Work” (*La poetica dell’opera aperta*). Eco
understood any “work of art” as a

> complete form and *closed* in its perfection as a perfectly calibrated
> organic whole \[which\] is also *open* because of the possibility of
> being interpreted in a thousand different ways without a resulting
> change in its irreproducible uniqueness.[^449]

It is Eco’s contention that a full awareness of this tension is a
peculiarly modern phenomenon, perhaps originating in the “open form”
(*forma aperta*) of baroque architecture.[^450] “Rather than suffer this
‘openness’ as an unavoidable fact,” Eco claims, the modern poet in
particular “enters it into a productive program, and indeed renders it
so as to foster in it the maximum possible number of ‘openings’.”[^451]
What Ovid is doing at the end of his poem is even more complex, however.
He gives the reader the opportunity to help construct the architextural
monument of his poem by leaving its imaginary structure open. This is
not to point to a sort of epistemological nihilism,[^452] nor to serve
merely as a sort of intellectual game; rather, on the contrary, the
poet’s narrative technique makes the reader a part of the “building”
process itself – and thereby gives the reader a stake in what Ovid has
to say about his or her identity. Ovid does this all throughout the
*Metamorphoses*, of course, as he forces the reader again and again to
make decisions about the poem’s many ambiguities.[^453] What the
conclusion does is to present a symbol for this process through Ovid’s
own transcendence of the very structure that represents his poem,
namely, his architextural *opus*.

To be a Roman in the Augustan age meant in part being able to read the
new structure of the metaphorical Roman state through the physical
landscape of the city itself. The ways in which Augustus himself
renegotiated the space of the city were grand and impressive to the eye
– but at the same time could be rather subtle and nuanced in the
language that he used to describe them. As this dissertation has shown,
in fact, for Augustus’ message to be appreciated fully the *princeps*
needed readers of his Rome who could interpret the often subtle
architectural gestures that he made whether in stone or in word. In
turning now to the *Res Gestae* for a final time, it will be possible to
see how Augustus also ends his own account of his monumentalization of
Rome by transcending the very boundaries of the structures that he
erected. In a similar way to Ovid’s poem, I argue, the conclusion of the
inscription allows its author to assume a power that blurs private and
public to such an extent that the boundaries themselves could be
radically reconstructed and even become temporarily unbound. Even more
importantly, though, Augustus’ Rome is shown to be a provisionally open
structure just like that of Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* – and one that
likewise needed the participation of the Roman people if it was to
achieve an enduring stability after the physical passing of its
builder.[^454]

###Part 2. Augustus’ Reconstruction of Roman Space###

“I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as a city of
brick.” In the *Res Gestae* the change that Roman space undergoes is
importantly not articulated through such an easy and explicit
architectural metaphor – as it is, for instance, in Vitruvius’
preface,[^455] or for that matter in the above boast of Augustus as
recorded in Suetonius.[^456] As previous chapters have demonstrated, the
*princeps* uses architecture in the text to articulate this
metamorphosis of the city in much more subtle ways, too. This is no
different when one turns to very end of the *Res Gestae*:

> tertium dec\[i\]mum consulatu\[m cum gereba\]m, sena\[tus et
> e\]quester ordo populusq\[ue\] Romanus universus **\[appell\]av\[it me
> p\]atr\[em p\]atriae**, idque **in vestibu\[lo a\]edium mearum
> inscribendum** et **in c\[u\]ria \[Iulia** e\]t **in foro
> Aug(usto)**...\[censuit.\] Cum scripsi haec annum agebam
> septuagensumum sextum. (*RGDA* 35.1)
>
> When I was consul for the thirteenth time, the senate, the equestrian
> order, and the Roman people in full agreement **gave me** **the title
> of *pater patriae***, and decreed that it should be inscribed **in the
> vestibule of my house** and **in the Curia Julia** and **in the Forum
> of Augustus**… When I wrote down these accomplishments of mine I was
> seventy-seven years old.

Here at the conclusion of the account of his accomplishments Augustus
lists three structures in which an inscription was placed proclaiming
him as *pater patriae* (“father of the fatherland”): first, in the
vestibule of his house (*in vestibulo aedium*); then, in the Curia Julia
(*in Curia Iulia*); and, finally, in his own forum (*in foro Augusto*).
As impressive as these structures might be (especially the forum),[^457]
this list is not just another statement of what Augustus has built in
Rome. He had already covered that topic sufficiently in paragraphs 19-21
of the *RGDA* that were discussed above in Chapter III.[^458] Much more
than a simple enumeration of structures Augustus is instead offering
here a final statement through his building enterprise of how he has
reconstructed the state during his reign. One might even say that the
*princeps* is saving his most revealing statement for last – not by
calling attention to these buildings as physical structures so much as
in the way that he has reconfigured the metaphorical boundaries that
exist between them. In short, Augustus uses his farewell – like the poet
Ovid – to demonstrate how he too has transcended the symbolic boundaries
of the edifices he “completed.”

Scholars have not entirely overlooked the way that Augustus uses the
trinity of his own home, his new senate house, and his innovative forum
to stress the creation of a new structure for the state that breaks down
the symbolic boundaries of private and public which existed between the
three forms. Both Edwin Ramage and Kristina Milnor argue that the frame
of the *Res Gestae* neatly encapsulates the transformation of Augustus
from a *privatus* citizen at the beginning to a “transcendent public
figure” by its end through the triple inscription of *pater
patriae*[^459] – though they differ on what exactly these spaces
represent. Whereas Ramage sees Augustus “go\[ing\] out of his way to
underline the religious, civil, and military applications of the title
when he points out it was to be displayed in three places,”[^460] Milnor
suggests that Augustus’ inclusion of his house here is not meant to
invoke a religious significance (as Ramage argues) so much as to extend
the meaning of *pater patriae* to the “private or domestic” aspect of
Roman life.[^461] Although Milnor is likely correct to understand the
inscription’s placement in the house as blurring the boundaries of
private and public, she follows Ramage’s reading of the *Forum Augustum*
here as merely a marker of Augustus’ power over the military. As I argue
below, however, it is the forum (together with what it symbolizes) that
has a rather important role for Augustus in how it allows him to open up
the boundaries of Roman space.

Before I discuss the forum, though, it is important first to consider
the meaning of the other two structures and their relationship to each
other in the text. It is not simply the work that Augustus did in
completing the new *Curia Julia* which is the point here so much as the
idea of the *curia* itself as a symbolic structure – one that has in a
sense now become a part of Augustus’ own house.[^462] The *curia*
represented the old “structure” of power.[^463] It was the location
where the “fathers” (*patres conscripti*) of the aristocracy deliberated
about the Roman state. Under Augustus, however, the *curia* now had a
new head of the Roman household: the *pater patriae* himself.[^464] When
juxtaposed so closely with the same inscription placed in Augustus’ own
house the significance of the words as inscribed on the *curia* becomes
even clearer: the twin inscriptions illustrate how Augustus has
reconfigured private and public in such a way as to blur the boundaries
of the categories,[^465] as his house and the old home of the Roman
“fathers” become joined through the words of the inscription – as well
as their placement next to each other here in the *Res Gestae* itself.

The addition of a third inscription in Augustus’ own forum complicates
this equation even further. As he does with the senate house, Augustus
is not inserting his forum into the *Res Gestae* at this point simply to
boast that he built it. The point is rather that the inscription
connects this new structure to the architectural seats of power from
both Rome’s past and present, in the *curia* and in his own house,
respectively. Augustus is adding still more meaning here, though,
because of how he had set a very specific narrative of Roman history
within his forum in a way akin to what Ovid accomplished in his
*Metamorphoses*.[^466] According to Suetonius, Augustus set the statues
of Rome’s great men within two colonnades of his forum and added the
proclamation:

> commentum id se, ut ad illorum vitam velut ad exemplar et ipse, dum
> viveret, et insequentium aetatium principes exigerentur a civibus.
> (*Div.* *Aug*. 31.5)
>
> I have done this so that both I myself, while alive, and the leaders
> of following ages may be compelled by the citizens to \[take\] the
> life of those \[men of old\] as an example.

By lining the heroes of Rome’s past within the space that bears his name
Augustus could structure a version of Roman history that was able to
provide a new frame for Roman identity after years of disunity and civil
discord.[^467] And by taking upon himself such a task Augustus thus
incorporated a very public structure into his own personal space. “In
effect,” as Diane Favro suggests, “the opulent Forum Augustum assumed
the position of atrium for the State, replete with representations of
revered ancestors.”[^468] Just as with the *Cura Julia*, then, Augustus
as *pater patriae* could create a structure through his own forum that
blurs the boundaries between private and public. What now counted as
Augustus’ “house” went far beyond its physical boundaries.

However, just as for Ovid’s structure in his *Metamorphoses*, if this
opening up of boundaries is to have some definition in reality, Augustus
needed to have the participation of the Roman citizens to give it a
sense of closure, particularly the elite whose opportunity for display
had become limited under Augustus.[^469] As the *princeps* himself
suggests in the above proclamation, the people of Rome are indeed the
judges; they are the ones, that is, who must ground in reality the sense
of Roman identity that Augustus’ monuments generate and who will
validate that narrative by compelling their leaders to follow it (cf.
*principes exigerentur a civibus*, *Div.* *Aug*. 31.5). By thus claiming
to have the same inscription of *pater patriae* posted in his forum as
in his house and his senate Augustus could emphatically introduce this
new structure and frame for Roman identity as a counterpart to the
structures that had shaped Roman space, private and public, in the
republic during its rise to prominence.

Reporting these three inscriptions in close juxtaposition at the very
conclusion of his *Res Gestae* therefore represents another way that the
*princeps* could articulate his essentially limitless power through the
physical structures he had established. He is not stressing their
innovative physical nature here, or their magnificence for that matter;
the *princeps* uses these architectural monuments, rather, in order to
present a new structure of the state – one in which Augustus becomes the
*paterfamilias* of Rome itself, that is, not only of his family in his
home, but also of the senate in the *curia*, and even of all Romans
past, present, and future in his own forum. Although he lists these
important “structures,” the conclusion to his *Res Gestae* stresses how
Augustus has opened Roman space up in such a way that he now had a power
which transcended the traditional limits of Rome’s structure itself –
and could thereby create a new one which would endure for
centuries.[^470]

The end of his monumental text is not an end for Augustus, though, just
as the conclusion of Ovid’s monumental *Metamorphoses* is not the end
for the poet. Both poet and *princeps* transcend their physical, private
bodies to become something that can live on after death, something
forever alive, something immortal.[^471] They both accomplish this by
concluding their works with architectural structures while
simultaneously opening them up in such a way as to invite the reader to
ground in reality the narratives that the monuments create. It is on the
reader to close the work and stabilize the structure, even a structure
whose boundaries are far from firm. It was not so much a god, one might
then say, as the Roman people themselves who ultimately granted that
Augustus’ domain become an *imperium sine fine*, “empire without end”
(Verg. *Aen*. 1.279) – both metaphorically within the city itself as
much as physically in the provinces.

Chapter II demonstrated how the Romans read their world architecturally.
In the decades of civil strife before Augustus came to power, however,
their faith in monuments to give stable meaning to their existence had
begun to falter, at least as it is presented in the works of writers
such as Livy and Horace examined above.[^472] In his project of
monumentalizing Rome, both the city and the idea, Augustus had to
restore the ability of monuments to help frame his subjects’ sense of
themselves as Romans in a new age. This was not as simple as merely
rebuilding the city more majestically and renovating its collapsed
public structures. The idea of the monument had to change, as well, in
order to allow for a redefinition of Roman identity that would both be
accepted in alignment with Rome’s past and then also endure into its
future. Whereas Vitruvius is relatively explicit in describing how
Augustus has transformed the state (both physically and metaphorically)
through his monumental architecture,[^473] Augustus’ architectural
discourse is more nuanced and thus enables him to articulate his own
very careful construction of Rome as one built anew but still upon the
foundations of Rome’s past *constitutio*. Although he did make Rome
grand through his monumental building projects, as Vitruvius is correct
to claim, the *princeps* also takes up the republican charge of making
sure that the structure of the *res publica* was not diminished.[^474]
His building program – however great in reality – is described
accordingly in a way that downplays his *physical* construction of
anything conspicuously new or out of line with Roman tradition lest it
suggest an explicit change to the metaphorical state, too. (No Mausoleum
of Augustus to be found in this inscription.) Augustus might have
rebuilt Rome as a city of marble, he might even have completely altered
the *constitutio* of the *res publica* itself, but one will not find
such talk in the *Res Gestae* because Augustus takes care in his use of
architectural language when presenting his literal and metaphorical
construction of the state. As this dissertation has demonstrated,
however, the way that the *princeps* does articulate the changes he
brought about to the structure of the state throughout his monumental
inscription does still put stress on his architectural projects – real
and metaphorical – even if Augustus uses them ultimately to stage his
own transcendence of the traditional boundaries between the public and
private spheres of Rome’s past.

The Roman poets of the Augustan age opened up and examined the
flexibility of monuments in a way that reflected an awareness of the
advantages and disadvantages of monumentality. They helped to create
readers who not only could read the monuments around them, but were also
able to interpret them actively as a part of the reconstruction of Rome
in their imaginations. This was not just a hermeneutical game. It was
absolutely critical if Augustus was to establish a new Rome upon the
foundations of the past one. The “deconstruction” of the monument as a
stable epistemological unit was not the goal; rather, it was the
*reconstruction* of the idea of the monument – and of Rome itself –
along lines that engaged Romans in the process.

[^393]: Cf. *RGDA* 1.4: *triumvir rei publicae constituendae*. For
    further analysis of this phrase from the beginning of the *Res
    Gestae* see above, pp. 43-46.

[^394]: Several scholars have tried to define the “revolution” of the
    Augustan age – from the political perspective of Syme 1936 to the
    “cultural revolutions” described by Habinek and Schiesaro 1997 and
    Wallace-Hadrill 2008. Regardless of the particular perspective,
    however, most are in agreement that it was indeed “a time of genuine
    transition, which was felt by all to varying degrees” (Galinsky
    1996, 238).

[^395]: Hinds 1987, 121, is right to claim that in the *Metamorphoses*
    “\[b\]oundaries are crossed and recrossed as in no poem before” – so
    much so in fact that it might be better, as I argue in this chapter,
    to see this as a transcendence of the very idea of a stable boundary
    rather than a nearly continuous crossing of boundaries within the
    poem

[^396]: As this chapter is about ends I will not be examining other
    structures in the *Metamorphoses* that could benefit from an
    architextural analysis of the sort proposed by this dissertation –
    the most notable being the Palace of the Sun in Book 2 of the poem
    (cf. *Met*. 2.1-30). For analysis of this monumental structure see
    R. Brown 1987 (with bibliography), Leech 1988, 459-452, Hardie 2002,
    177-178, and Feldherr 2010, 280-289, where he notes that the
    placement of this episode at the opening of Book 2 “equates the
    process of beginning the book with entering a *domus*.”

[^397]: Feeney 1991, 189. See also Galinsky 1996, 262, arguing that
    “\[t\]he *Metamorphoses* is a kaleidoscope of literary forms and
    moods – drama both comic and tragic, mime, hymn, catalog poetry,
    epic, epigram, epyllion, and elegy, to name only the most
    important.”

[^398]: Hinds 1987, 121.

[^399]: See Farrell 1992 for a reading of the poem in relation to its
    genre that approximates a deconstructive approach.

[^400]: The idea of a text as simultaneously “open” and “closed” as put
    forth by Eco 1962 \[1976\] has been very influential for my
    interpretation of the poem as such. Eco thinks an awareness of this
    understanding of art is modern, claiming that “certainly an artist
    of a few centuries ago was far from being intellectually aware of
    this fact” (*certamente un artista di qualche secolo fa era assai
    lontano dall’essere criticamente cosciente di questa realità*, 36).
    That seems unfair to what Ovid is doing in his *Metamorphoses*. As I
    will discuss below, pp, 177-179, his poem addresses the issue of
    “open” and “closed” in a more nuanced manner than Eco’s conception
    of the idea initially allows for. See also Roberts, Dunn, and Fowler
    1997, which contains several essays on the theme of “closure” (or
    the lack thereof) in Greek and Roman literature, including Barchiesi
    1997, 184-200, presenting an analysis of the end of the
    *Metamorphoses* in this light. The transcendence of structure
    suggests not merely a lack of closure, however, but rather the
    gesturing on the part of the author for the reader to provide
    closure.

[^401]: The Latin text of the *Metamorphoses* here and following is from
    Tarrant 2004.

[^402]: See Holzberg 1997, 123: “Four verses, not more. But they are
    full of important statements about the work – directly and
    indirectly” (*Vier Verse, mehr nicht. Doch sie sind reich an
    wichtigen Aussagen über das Werk – direkten und indirekten*). For
    additional discussion of the proem see also: Herter 1948; von
    Albrecht 1961; Bömer 1969, 11-16; Kenney 1976; Knox 1986, 9-11;
    Hinds 1987, 120-132; Myers 1994, 1-5; Spahlinger 1996, 27-40;
    Holzberg 1997, 123-125; O’Hara 2004/2005; and Feldherr 2010, 1-3.

[^403]: See Kenney 1976, 46-47, for how *nova* signals that Ovid is
    embarking on something new as a poet, and Spahlinger 1996, 28,
    discussing the importance of *nova* to the poet’s subtle claim of
    surpassing his predecessors. Galinsky 1996, 261, claims that the
    poem’s “raconteurial geniality should not mislead us: it was a
    highly ambitious undertaking, one, in fact, that was without
    precedent, as Ovid rightly emphasizes in the very first line of the
    poem (*in* *nova fert animus*).”

[^404]: Viarre 1964, 357, states that “\[o\]ne can only wonder if this
    is a historical human time, or a mythical time” (*On peut seulement
    se demander s’il s’agit d’un temps humain historique, ou d’un temps
    mythique*).

[^405]: See Fantham 2004, 5, who rhetorically asks us: “But isn’t it the
    other way round? Bodies are transformed into new shapes: it is the
    shapes that change.” But see Anderson 1963, 23, claiming that
    “\[o\]ne of the most important themes from the *Metamorphoses* is
    that *forma* has more than a passive quality. Not only is it
    changed, but it also causes change.”

[^406]: Hinds 1987, 132.

[^407]: See Bömer 1969, 15, where he compares Ovid’s wording here to
    Horace in *Odes* 3.30.13-14 (*princeps* *Aeolium carmen ad ltalos* /
    *deduxisse modos*) and Propertius 1.16.41 (*saepe novo deduxi
    carmina versu*). Cf. also Verg. *Ecl*. 6.5: *oportet*…*deductum
    dicere carmen*.

[^408]: Knox 1986, 9. An oft-cited discussion of this topic can be found
    in Herter 1948. See also Kenney 1976, 51-52, claiming that the proem
    seems to present a “contradiction in terms” because “a poem cannot
    be both ‘deductum’ and ‘perpetuum,’ both Callimachean and
    un-Callimachean,” as well as Hinds 1987, 121, arguing that “\[t\]he
    *Metamorphoses* aspires to be a *perpetuum carmen,* one of those
    continuous epic poems of many thousands of lines on kings and heroes
    deplored in the preface to Callimachus’ *Aetia*; but the aspiration
    is at once rendered problematic by the word *deducite,* which hints
    that the poem will also seek to align itself with the opposing,
    unepic tradition of the *deductum carmen,* the slender Muse
    preferred by the *Aetia* preface.” Spahlinger 1996, 36, suggests
    that the proem sets the stage for a poem that will be “the mixture
    of Ennian genius and Callimachean art” (*die Verbindung von
    ennianischem* ingenium *mit kallimacheischer* ars), while Holzberg
    1997, 124, concludes that in sharp contrast to Callimachus’ opening
    “it is precisely a ‘continuous song’ which the prefaces of the
    *Metamorphoses* announces” (*ist es…gerade so ein ‘kontinuierliches
    Lied’, das die Vorrede der* Metamorphosen *ankündigt*).

[^409]: Hinds 1987, 121. See also Feeney 1991, 188, arguing that
    “\[f\]rom its first lines the poem continually confronts us with the
    problem of the extent to which, and the ways in which, it is and is
    not epic.”

[^410]: Myers 1994, 4, maintains that “Ovid by using this term
    \[*perpetuum carmen*\] suggests that his poem will indeed conform to
    traditional Homeric epic standards of magnitude, chronological
    continuity (*ab origine* ... *ad mea tempora*), and thematic
    grandeur, but in no other sense can the *Metamorphoses* be
    considered a conventional *epos*.”

[^411]: See Farrell 1992, 267, where in expanding his analysis of
    Polyphemus’ polyphonic song to the rest of the poem he concludes
    that “the voice of the authorial narrator throughout the poem” is
    one “that persistently undermines itself, problematizing its own
    authority – a voice, that is, in dialogue with itself.” See also
    Wickkiser 1999, 115-116, paraphrasing Farrell as: “\[T\]he
    *Metamorphoses* is characterized by a dialogue, rather than a
    compartmentalization of genres.”

[^412]: Fantham 2004, 131. Unlike Farrell 1992, however, Fantham
    understands a sense of harmony between the different strands,
    comparing the poem also to “a complex necklace whose central strand
    sustains loops (both short and long) of beads of different colors
    and materials, which separate and rejoin the main ordered sequence
    at different places to create an overall symmetry.” See also O’Hara
    2004/2005, 158-159, suggesting that Ovid’s proem in particular “is
    evoking both the epic and elegiac tradition of worrying about the
    problem of whether human and divine motivation are to be seen as
    complementary or contradictory.”

[^413]: Knox 1986, 6. See also Kenney 1976, 46, warning us that even the
    form of the proem, consisting of only four lines, is a reversal of
    expectations for a poem that is around 12,000 lines long. “That very
    brevity,” according to Kenney, “ought to put us on our guard.”

[^414]: Segal 1969b, 289.

[^415]: See Holzberg 1997, 158: “The theme of the work is…humankind
    within a constantly changing world” (*Das Thema des Werkes ist…der
    Mensch innerhalb einer permanent sich wandelnden Welt*).

[^416]: As Barchiesi 1994, 263, points out in regards to the title
    itself: “\[t\]he heading of the work, *Metamorphoses*, heightens the
    sensitivity of the reader for all that is temporary, mobile, open to
    revisions. Signals and effects of closing tend to control this flow,
    but are in turn exposed to a sense of continuous rearrangement, and
    displacement” (*\[l\]a testata dell’opera, Trasformazioni, acuisce
    la sensibilità del lettore per tutto ciò che è provvisorio, mobile,
    esposto a revisioni. Segnali ed effetti di chiusura tendono a
    controllare questo flusso, ma sono a loro volta esposti a un senso
    di rimaneggiamento continuo, e si spiazzano*).

[^417]: Wheeler 1995, 117. In discussing how the focus on change in the
    proem influences one’s reading of the “cosmic ordering” of the world
    that follows in Book 1, Wheeler goes on to claim that “\[t\]he very
    provisionality of this cosmic order serves only to highlight Ovid’s
    continual redefinition of his poetic project” (118). See also
    Feldherr 2010, 35, 37, stating that “metamorphosis throughout the
    poem is something that must be continually reimagined… \[T\]he
    poet’s own definition of change is itself changeable.”

[^418]: Fowler 1995b, 14. For Fowler, in fact, “\[t\]he Ovidian
    viewpoint on segmentation is that it is inevitable and necessary,
    but always provisional: it is not wrong to divide up the world or
    the text, but it is wrong to think that one’s divisions are eternal,
    that there is one right way to segment phenomena.”

[^419]: Cf. Ov. *Met*. 1.751-2.400 (Phaethon), 4.604-5.249 (Perseus),
    7.404-9.97 (Theseus), 10.1-11.66 (Orpheus), and 13.623-14.582 (the
    “Little” *Aeneid*).

[^420]: For example, the story of Pyramus and Thisbe (*Met*. 4.55-166)
    is embedded in the story of the daughters of Minyas (4.1-415). The
    famous tale of Pygmalion and his statue (10.243-297) is one of the
    many stories that Orpheus tells in the poem (10.143-10.739), which
    also includes the tale of Venus and Adonis (10.503-739), with Venus
    herself narrating the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes (10.560-680).

[^421]: Feldherr 2010 provides an incredibly subtle reading of the
    different narrative levels in the *Metamorphoses* that demonstrates
    the remarkable fluidity and evasiveness of the poem’s narrative
    structure. See also Coleman 1971, Barchiesi 1989, Keith 1992, Tissol
    1997, Solodow 1988, Wheeler 2000, and Rosati 2002.

[^422]: Nearly every full account of Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* touches upon
    its controversial conclusion. Some of the scholarship that has most
    shaped my own interpretation includes: Fränkel 1945 \[1969\],
    110-111; Anderson 1963, 27; Segal 1969b; Leach 1974, 134-135;
    Woodman 1974, 127-128; Bömer 1986 488-451; Feeney 1991, 248-249;
    Barchiesi 1994, 262-265; Spahlinger 1996, 40-50; Barchiesi 1997,
    184-200; Holzberg 1997, 153-158; Solodow 1988, 220-222; Wickkiser
    1999; Fowler 2000, 195-196; Hardie 2002, 91-97; Habinek 2002, 54-57;
    and Feldherr 2010, 78-83.

[^423]: See Solodow 1988, 52-53, claiming that “there is nothing
    traditionally epic in the first-person discourse at the close of the
    *Metamorphoses.* The passage which ends the poem (15.871-79) is a
    lengthy statement of the poet’s own immortality, more closely
    resembling personal lyric – Horace *Odes* 3.30 is the chief model –
    than anything familiar from more ‘objective’ narrative.”

[^424]: Just as Ovid is almost everywhere else in the poem, as well. See
    Galinsky 1996, 262-266, where he argues that the “the
    *Metamorphoses* is an almost constant dialogue with the *Aeneid*” in
    terms of “verbal reminiscences” as well as more importantly its
    status as an “alternative to Vergil’s interpretation of myth.”

[^425]: See Spahlinger 1996, 46, stating that *Iamque opus exegi* is
    “*eine bewußte Aufnahme*” of Horace’s *Exegi monumentum*. For
    comparisons of the two poems see also Woodman 1974, 127-128, Solodow
    1988, 222-223, Wickkiser 1999, 127-129, and Feldherr 2010, 82.

    see Wickkiser 1999, 113.

[^427]: Woodman 1974, 127.

[^428]: Wickkiser 1999, 129.

[^429]: Wickkiser 1999, 127. Feldherr 2010, 82, presents a more subtle
    and compelling reading of these lines, claiming that “Ovid’s final
    account of his completed *opus* has been claimed to approximate such
    imperial constructs, but another glance back at the Horatian
    intertext complicates this impression. Horace unambiguously spoke of
    his text as a *monumentum;* Ovid employs the much broader *opus,*
    making the building metaphor less insistent, if still available.”

[^430]: See Woodman 1974, 127-128: “It is hardly a compliment to himself
    if Ovid says that a mere ‘sword’ (*ferrum*) will not destroy his
    *opus*.” Woodman goes so far in fact as to criticize Ovid’s slight
    anthropomorphization of time and age “as if they were a man with
    sharp teeth who attacks monuments and the like” (128).

[^431]: Woodman 1974, 128.

[^432]: Solodow 1988, 221-222.

[^433]: See Zetzel 1982, 96, claiming that in *C*. 3.30 Horace’s “poetry
    has become the virtual equivalent of epic.”

[^434]: Solodow 1988, 222.

[^435]: Solodow 1988, 222.

[^436]: On the subjectivity of Ovid’s narrator in the *Metamorphoses*
    see also Leach 1988, 440-467, where she argues that “\[w\]ith its
    discrepancy between authoritative information and ethical
    indeterminacy, the poem engages us in a world that is neither evil
    nor negative, but recognizably fallible and human. To this end we
    may understand Ovid’s controlled point of view as a knowing
    illustration of the way persuasion aims to activate our responses by
    making us see, hear, and feel” (466).

[^437]: Solodow 1988, 220.

[^438]: Solodow 1988, 222. See also Spahlinger 1995, 40, claiming
    similarly that “the sphragis of Ovid is about nothing else but the
    author himself and his certainty of future glory” (*handelt die
    Sphragis Ovids von nichts anderem als von dem Autor selbst und
    seiner Gewißheit künftigen Ruhmes*), and Ramsby 2005, 389, where –
    citing the final line of the poem – the scholar suggests that “the
    reason that Ovid wrote at all” was in fact “to achieve immortality
    in and through his words.” Knox 1986, 79-80, sees the *sphragis* as
    less about Ovid himself than “an assertion of the intrinsic worth of
    his poem, which is alone enough to guarantee immortality to the
    poet’s name.”

[^439]: See above, pp. 29-36, for a discussion of the idea of structure
    as an essential component of monumentality. The transcendence of
    structure does not mean Ovid’s response is necessarily an
    “anti-Augustan” one; rather, as I suggest below, such a strategy is
    one that the *princeps* himself employs. For views of the poem’s
    ending that see it as blatantly “anti-Augustan” see Fränkel 1945
    \[1969\] (111: “one sharp clarion note of defiance”) and Segal 1969b
    (290: “a rude anticlimax”). In more recent years, of course, such a
    negative view of the Ovid’s poem – as well as the whole anti- vs.
    pro-Augustan dichotomy in general – has been seen as too simplistic
    (Galinsky 1996, *passim*, esp. 228; Wickkiser 1999) and/or lacking
    in evidence (Bömer 1986, 490-491; Knox 1986, 79; Holzberg 1997,
    154-155).

[^440]: See Hardie 2002, 96, stating that “Ovid himself will become the
    fixed enduring monument.”

[^441]: Wickkiser 1999, 135, claims that “\[t\]he image that Ovid
    creates with *super astra* is itself remarkable. It is unprecedented
    in statements of poetic prowess.” For Ovid’s journey beyond the
    stars see also: Feeney 1991, 249: “Ovid will go higher than the
    stars, and become a book”; Barchiesi 1994, 262: “This is more than a
    catasterism: above the stars the poet has a sort of immortality
    beyond that of a Caesar. His work will not be able to be destroyed
    by *Iovis ira* (15.871), the most obvious signifier of Augustan
    power (*Questo è più di un catasterismo: sopra le stelle, il poeta
    ha una sorta di immortalità ultracesarea. La sua opera sarà
    indistruttibile per la* Iovis ira (*15,871*)*, il più ovvio
    significante del potere augusteo*); Hardie 2002, 93: “Ovid will both
    fly above the stars, outdoing the apotheoses of Hercules, Aeneas,
    Romulus, and Julius Caesar, and be omnipresent on earth (877-8); his
    very last ‘dying word’, the *nouissimum uerbum* in this poem of
    novelties, is *uiuam* ‘I shall live’”; and Feldherr 2010, 81: “The
    sense of a poetic trumping of the ‘historical’ immortality of the
    divinized emperor comes above all from Ovid’s vow to be carried
    above the stars; if Caesar was star quality, so to speak, Ovid has
    surpassed him.”

[^442]: See pp. 29-36, esp. 29-31, above.

[^443]: Hardie 2002, 94. Indeed, according to Hardie, “the living
    presence of the poet *is* the text, the poem as a whole, into which
    the mortal person has been transformed.” See also Feeney 1991, 249,
    for the interpretation that Ovid is describing his transformation
    into a book (cited above, p. 175, n. 49), and similarly Fowler 2000,
    196, where he claims that “Ovid’s name will be indelible, he will
    never suffer the newly popular erasure of *damnatio memoriae*, but
    it will be indelible not because of oral reperformance but because
    of the empire-wide book trade which ensures his victory over
    Augustus’ attempts at suppression. Ovid’s name will last because…his
    works will continue to exist through constant recopying and
    reinterpretation by the reader.”

[^444]: Ovid’s scope can even be said to extend beyond what Ennius sang
    of in his epic *Annales*, namely, Roman history from the end of the
    Trojan War all the way to his own time in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Century BCE.

[^445]: Leach 1974, 135, puts it well in claiming that “Ovid does not
    identify himself with the fragile artists who have fared so poorly
    in his mythical world, but rather boasts of a power of survival like
    that of Hercules, Aeneas and the Caesars: the god-favored heroes of
    force. By this very gesture, he reminds us that they are all persons
    in a mythical world that his own imagination has created. As *ira
    Iovis*, even Augustus’ own displeasure is relegated to the world of
    myth.”

[^446]: Although Wickkiser 1999, 141, is correct to argue that “all of
    the ideas in the *sphragis* ground Ovid as a Roman,” the poet is
    also giving definition to his Roman audience by transforming his
    private, personal vision of the Roman world into a shared
    perspective common to the public through his poem. For a view that
    seeks to separate Ovid from his Roman context, however, see also
    Solodow 1988, 220-222 (discussed above, pp. 173-174). Anderson 1969,
    27, Leach 1998, 440-467, and Galinsky 1996, 238-264, each sees Ovid
    as focusing more on the “human” than the “Roman” in the
    *Metamorphoses* – and it is that more humanistic perspective,
    according to them, which seems to account for the poem’s enduring
    quality more than anything else.

[^447]: See Habinek 2002, 54-55, for an interesting argument regarding
    Ovid’s use of *patet* as meaning “lies open” in line 877. “To say
    that Roman power lies open,” according to Habinek, “indicates that
    it brooks no rival, it has no reason to surround itself with guards,
    it is open to all.” The full expression would seem to receive extra
    emphasis from the fact that it is actually “a reversal compared to
    the usual notion ‘*terra pate potentiae*’” (*eine Umkehrung
    gegenüber der üblichen Vorstellung* ‘terra patet potentiae’”), as
    noted by Bömer 1986, 480, *ad loc*.

[^448]: For a discussion of “monumentality” as defined in this
    dissertation see above, pp. 29-36.

[^449]: Eco 1962 \[1976\], 34: *un’opera d’arte, forma compiuta e*
    chiusi *nella sua perfezione di organismo perfettamente calibrato, è
    altresí* aperta, *possibilità di essere interpretata in mille modi
    diversi senza che la sua irreproducibile singolarità ne risulti
    alterata*.

[^450]: Eco 1962 \[1976\], 38. Although it may be no coincidence that
    Eco looks to architecture as one of the earliest examples of the
    “open” work, the theorist does not seem to reflect much upon the
    architectural nature of the spatial metaphors he is employing.

[^451]: Eco 1962 \[1976\], 36: *…anziché subire la ‘apertura’ come dato
    di fatto inevitabile, la elegge a programma produttivo, ed anzi
    offre l’opera in modo da promuovere la massima aperture possibile*.”

[^452]: Feldherr 2010, 80, suggests that “when we read of the poet’s
    indestructible name, we wonder whether it is materially
    indestructible…or whether it is indestructible precisely because
    there is nothing there to destroy.” Although Feldherr’s reading of
    the epilogue is very subtle, it tends towards an implicitly negative
    reading that seems to take away from Ovid’s very positive claim
    about Roman identity.

[^453]: In speaking generaly about the poem, Galinsky 1996, 264, claims
    that “\[w\]hen we try to locate the author’s point of view, we are
    faced with considerable elusiveness. From the perspective of reader
    participation, however, which in typical Augustan fashion is
    strongly invited, the effect is to open up the narration of the
    myths to various reader responses.”

[^454]: I am not the first to suggest that the kind of participation
    required by the reader in the *Metamophoses* has parallels to the
    kinds of mental tasks which faced a Roman in the Augustan age more
    broadly. For instance, Feldherr 2010, 83, proposes that “the kind of
    interpretative choices required of Ovid’s audience really do imitate
    and reproduce the hermeneutic challenges that lay at the core of the
    political impact of the emperor’s actual monuments.” See also
    Galinsky 1996, 228-229, arguing that “the *Metamorphoses* calls for
    the constant participation of the beholder. There is an authorial
    center as the poet is very much in evidence, ultimately tying
    together the heterogeneity and flux of the material: the parallel
    with Augustus’ similar role in the public realm is suggestive,” as
    well as Wickkiser 1999, 122-123, where she claims that the
    *sphragis* in particular is “a response to Augustus and the Augustan
    period” because it employs an architectural metaphor to define
    itself. Although Wickkiser does look to the *Res Gestae* in her
    article on the end of the *Metamorphoses*, her focus is not on
    Augustus’ language, and she looks mostly to the physical buildings
    of his reign. There is no study I know of that examines how
    Augustus’ strategy at the end of the *Res Gestae* has a counterpart
    in the conclusion of Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* despite the similarities
    that I will now point out below.

[^456]: This boast is not quite as simple as it appears, either. See
    above, p. 11, for further discussion of its subtle nuances of
    meaning.

[^457]: On the Forum of Augustus and its architectural program see:
    Zanker 1968; Luce 1990, 123-138; Kockel 1995, 285-295; Galinsky
    1996, 197-213; Favro 1996, 175-178; and Spannagel 1999. For how the
    Forum reflected a change in the structure of the state in particular
    see also Syme 1936, 470-471, where the historian claims that
    “\[t\]his dynastic monument is a reminder, if such be needed, that
    Dux was disguised but not displaced by Princeps,” and Hölscher 2006,
    247-248, suggesting that the Caryatids which were placed in
    Augustus’ Forum help to represent “contemporary ‘state architecture’
    – in the concrete as well as the metaphorical sense.” According to
    Ewald and Noreña 2010b, 16, the Forum of Augustus represented one of
    the “hybrid forms of space in which the ‘dual’
    republican-monarchical character of the Principate was very clearly
    articulated.”

[^459]: Milnor 2005, 26.

[^460]: Ramage 1987, 84.

[^461]: Milnor 2005, 26: “The places correspond to the different aspects
    of Roman society on which the title touches, the civic in the Curia
    Julia where the senate met, the military in the representation of
    Augustus *triumphator*, and the private or domestic in the reference
    to Augustus’ house.”

[^462]: On Augustus and the *Curia Iulia* see Zanker 1988, 54-55, 79-81,
    with images of the building on coins that “symbolize Octavian’s
    promise…to restore the Republic.”

[^463]: According to Favro 1996, 156, “\[i\]n the Republic, Romans
    linked the status of a city with the appearance of its central
    administrative building, the curia.” Favro cites as evidence Vitr.
    5.2.1, which states that “most of all the curia in particular must
    be constructed with an eye to the dignity of its town or state”
    (*maxime quidem curia in primis est facienda ad dignitatem municipii
    sive civitatis*). Cf. also Cic. *Cat*. 4.2, where the Roman orator
    claims that the old *curia* in Rome was “the greatest refuge for all
    peoples” (*summum auxilium omnium gentium*).

[^464]: For Augustus as a father figure of the state see Strothmann
    2000, *passim*, and especially 73-80, where the scholar stresses the
    link that Augustus tried to create between himself as
    *paterfamilias* of the *domus Augusta* and as *pater patriae* of the
    *res publica*. On the term *pater patriae* itself see also Alföldi
    1971 and in this context Ramage 1987, 104-109, and Cooley 2009,
    273-275, *ad loc*., claiming that “the title *pater patriae* evoked
    the connotations of the father figure in Roman society, reflecting
    not only the affection and responsibility a father feels towards his
    children, familiar to modern society, but also the obedience
    required by Roman law from children to their father, as enshrined in
    the principle of *patria potestas*, paternal power” (274).

[^465]: Milnor 2005, 47-93, provides an excellent discussion of the way
    that Augustus’ complex of buildings on the Palatine, including his
    own house and adjacent temple of Apollo, helped to demonstrate
    visually as well as symbolically the redefinition of the boundaries
    between public and private space. In short, Milnor concludes that
    “\[t\]he Palatine complex…serve\[d\] to underscore certain concrete
    issues about the relationship between public and private space in
    the Augustan age, and also, in a symbolic sense, to address the
    question of what it means for a single individual to take to himself
    alone the power which used to belong to an entire community” (50).
    Milnor cites as a crucial piece of evidence a passage from Cassius
    Dio that suggests how Augustus’ house was at once both private and
    public, open and closed. “When Augustus had constructed his house,”
    according to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-century CE historian, “he donated it to the
    state, whether because of the contribution from the people to him,
    or since he was high priest, in order that he could live in places
    that were simultaneously private and public” (ὁ δὲ Αὔγουστος τὴν
    οἰκίαν οἰκοδομήσας ἐδημοσίωσε πᾶσαν, εἴτε δὴ διὰ τὴν συντέλειαν τὴν
    παρὰ τοῦ δήμου οἱ γενομένην, εἴτε καὶ ὅτι ἀρχιέρεως ἦν, ἵν’ ἐν τοῖς
    ἰδίοις ἅμα καὶ ἐν τοῖς κοινοῖς οἰκοίη, Dio 55.12.5).

[^466]: Barchiesi 2005 presents a good recent overview of the Forum’s
    relationship to the poetry of the Augustan age. He does not try,
    however, to connect what the *princeps* is doing in the *Forum*
    *Augustum* (or in the *RGDA* for that matter) to the end of Ovid’s
    *Metamorphoses*.

[^467]: See Zanker 1988, 211-212, stressing that “\[t\]here can be no
    doubt that Augustus participated directly in designing this program
    and in the selection of the *summi viri.* According to Pliny (*N.H.*
    22.6.13), he was even thought to have composed the *elogia*
    inscribed below the statues himself.”

[^468]: Favro 1996, 126-127. As Favro goes on to say, moreover, Augustus
    further “strengthen\[ed\] the metaphorical link between the new
    forum and the *domus* atria of the *paterfamilias*” in the way that
    “the great *Forum Augustum* became a center for the worship of the
    *Lares* and *Genius Augusti*” (127).

[^469]: See Zanker 1988, 291-292, stating that “\[t\]he fact that
    Augustus now dispensed public honors and determined who would
    receive a statue in the available space still remaining in the
    *Forum Augustum* obviated any desire for extravagant
    self-glorification.” For senatorial display within their own homes
    during the early empire see also Wiseman 1987, as well as Eck 1984
    and Eck 1997. Mayer 2010 makes the intriguing argument that there
    was still an opportunity for senatorial display in the act of
    praising the emperor, as many of the Augustan monuments were in fact
    “decreed” by the senate and the people of Rome. In other words,
    according to Mayer, “imperial propaganda” may have been more of a
    two-way dialogue than Zanker and his adherents suggest.

[^470]: Milnor 2005, 303-304, concludes her study of Augustan space by
    claiming that “one of the things which made the Roman Empire work in
    its first inception” was “the ability of the Augustan age to
    represent itself as a different kind of answer to the problems which
    had long beset the res publica, *constructing a new system which
    transcended the divide between public and private life*” (my
    emphasis).

[^471]: See Bosworth 1999 for an account of how the *RGDA* contains
    allusions to the “Hellenistic doctrine of apotheosis,” particularly
    to “the ‘Sacred Record’ of Euhemerus, which had become a Latin
    classic through Ennius’ translation” (1). Milnor 2005, 27, is right
    to note that “Augustus as the representative of household virtue is
    still very much alive at the text’s conclusion *even though Octavian
    the private citizen has long since perished*” (my emphasis). In this
    way, then, it would seem that both poet and *princeps* end up in the
    same place: forever alive in the imagination of the Roman public.
