This dissertation explores the idea of the monument in the Roman imagination of
the Augustan age (31 BCE – 14 CE). It examines the different ways in which three
Augustan poets – Horace in his *Odes*, Vergil in his *Aeneid*, and Ovid in his
*Metamorphoses* – imagined their works as monuments that contributed to the
broader discourse of monumentality of the period. A survey of the importance of
architecture to how the Romans structured the world around them conceptually
will be followed in each subsequent chapter by a reading of these poems which
seeks to accomplish two goals: (1) to demonstrate the very nuanced manner in
which the Augustan poets fashioned their works as *monumenta* (“monuments”) and
(2) to connect aspects of the poems’ monumentality to strategies employed by the
princeps himself in his *Res Gestae* when discussing his reconstruction of Rome
on both a literal and metaphorical level. This study will argue that by
analyzing the sophisticated manner in which these poets contributed to the
monumentalization of their city we can understand better the success that
Augustus had in turning Rome from a city of brick to one of marble – not just in
its physical landscape, but in the Roman imagination, as well. The conclusion
will then look at what the Roman understanding of monumentality in the Augustan
age can reveal about possible limitations of the discourse surrounding the idea
of the monument today.
