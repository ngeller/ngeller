          <p>“I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as a city of
          brick.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Augustus’ famous boast is not without merit. The people of
          Rome no doubt witnessed an incredible amount of building in their city
          under the reign of the <em>princeps</em>. For nearly two millennia historians
          have praised the Augustan age for its prolific and resplendent
          architecture.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Classicists in particular have analyzed Augustus’
          sophisticated building program in order to show how the visual culture
          of Rome was an essential component of the so-called Augustan “(Cultural)
          Revolution” that saw the city rise out of decades of civil war into an
          era of peace and relative stability.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The recent attention to, and
          fascination with, the physical remains of Rome’s many Augustan monuments
          – small or large, functional or commemorative – is a testament to just
          how successfully Augustus employed architecture to monumentalize not
          just the city of Rome, but the very idea of the city in the imagination
          of the Romans, as well as in the minds of their cultural inheritors.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This dissertation is not about the physical monuments that Augustus
          constructed. Important work still remains to be done in that field of
          study as classicists complete the “spatial turn” and transition from an
          examination of space to that of movement in and through space.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The
          different focus of my dissertation is rather because some of the most
          important monumental constructions that Augustus accomplished were not
          constructed with extravagant, long-lasting marble, but with the words of
          the Latin language in his <em>Res Gestae</em>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Augustus did monumentalize
          the city of Rome, of course, but he also “constructed” the <em>res publica</em>
          anew after years of civil strife had left it in “ruin.” That was his
          charge, after all, when he first assumed power as a <em>triumvir rei
          publicae constituendae</em>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> As this study will suggest, an essential
          part of Augustus’ success in accomplishing this task was in how he
          skillfully used architectural <em>discourse</em> to establish his novel
          <em>constitutio</em> for Rome – the one in the imagination as much as the
          physical one – upon foundations that were at the same time
          traditional.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Augustus was not alone in using architectural discourse to articulate
          the work he did to reshape the idea of Rome. Far from it. To think that
          the <em>princeps</em> was operating outside the shared discourse of his times
          is no doubt a mistake – and one that does not fully account for his
          success.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Chapter II of this dissertation will demonstrate the
          important role that architectural discourse and in particular the idea
          of the monument played for Romans in how they “structured” the world
          around them, whether rhetorical or literary, actual or symbolic. This
          largely introductory chapter will start with an analysis of the only
          surviving intact architectural treatise from antiquity, Vitruvius’ <em>De
          architectura</em>, which was addressed to Augustus himself. I will analyze
          in particular the treatise’s architectural imagery so as to draw out
          further the close connection that existed between architecture and the
          idea of “order” or “structure” in the Roman imagination.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> From this
          point I will then turn to perhaps the most famous example of this
          connection in antiquity: the “memory mansion” that was used by Roman
          orators as an <em>aide</em>-<em>mémoire</em>. The idea of using architecture to
          “structure” one’s thoughts is not limited to constructing memory,
          however, but is in fact emblematic of a much deeper connection that
          existed between physical structures and the way Romans conceived of the
          world around them conceptually. And nowhere is this relationship more
          apparent than in the Roman idea of monumentality, that is, those
          characteristics which make something into a <em>monumentum</em> (“monument”). A
          discussion of Roman monumentality will lead then to an analysis of two
          Augustan authors who demonstrate the concept in action, namely, the
          historian Livy in the preface of his <em>Ab urbe condita</em> and the
          <em>princeps</em> himself at the beginning of his own <em>Res Gestae</em>.</p>
          
          <p>This examination of monumental architecture’s relationship to Roman
          thought as found in these prose texts is essential to establishing a new
          interpretative framework through which to analyze the way that the poets
          of the Augustan age conceived of their works as <em>monumenta</em>. Most
          studies on the poetic <em>monumenta</em> that will be analyzed in this
          dissertation have examined either [1] the metapoetics at work in each
          case (e.g., as a “competition,” whether between Greek vs. Roman, past
          vs. present, or visual vs. verbal media),<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> or [2] tried to match
          these “structures” with actual monuments in Augustan Rome.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Although
          I will also draw upon both approaches in this dissertation, my goal is
          to explore how the poets who built these <em>monumenta</em> are interacting
          with – that is, employing as well as critiquing – the architectural
          <em>discourse</em> that existed in Augustan Rome and which was used by Augustus
          himself to articulate his monumentalization of the city.</p>
          
          <p>The prose texts examined in Chapter II will provide a framework for
          interpreting the poetic monuments of the Augustan age in a new light.
          But why poetry? What does it offer that further analysis of prose
          cannot? The Greco-Roman tradition is full of poets who imagined their
          works architecturally<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> – whether as grand, stable structures,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
          or in the case of Hellenistic poetry as a means of articulating their
          (supposedly) much smaller poetic aspirations.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> The Augustan poets
          were thus working within a long-standing, established tradition that
          attached architectural imagery to what we today might call a poem’s
          “generic structure.” For these poets to make a metapoetic statement via
          architectural imagery was a highly self-reflexive enterprise – one which
          not only called attention to their poetic predecessors, but also allowed
          them to articulate their own poems as a particular type of poetry.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>
          These intensely marked “architextural” moments therefore enabled the
          Augustan poets in particular to explore the monumentalization of the
          space around them in a critical way as they contemplated how their own
          works <em>qua</em> “monuments” would contribute to it.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>A bit about definitions before I provide a summary of the remaining
          chapters which will follow. I use the term “architexture” in this
          dissertation not to call to mind the complex architectonic
          “topomorphology” of Augustan age poetry that has been the focus of
          countless studies on its structural arrangement (in terms of books,
          individual poems, lines, etc.).<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Nor do I use “architexture” in a
          loose way to talk about how “memory is constructed like a text.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> My
          use of the term is closes to how the influential French narratologist
          Gérard Genette employed the almost impossibly nuanced concept of
          “<em>architextualité</em>” for thinking about how a text fits into a particular
          generic structure (or what he calls an “<em>archigenre</em>”).<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Genette is
          not concerned, however, with the more straightforward way that texts
          themselves can configure this relationship in their very language. My
          use of the word architexture is meant to examine this connection, that
          is, to explore how architecture is an operative metaphor in Horace,
          Vergil, and Ovid for how they imagine the generic “structures” of their
          own poetry. This dissertation is not simply about metapoetics, however.
          I argue that the act of defining their poetry’s architexture offered
          these three poets a vehicle through which to engage critically with the
          discourse surrounding architectural monuments – a discourse which itself
          was critical to reshaping and redefining Rome in the Augustan age.</p>
          
          <p>Chapters III-VI will demonstrate the relative strengths and weaknesses
          of this discourse by examining the monumental architexture of Horace’s
          <em>Odes</em> (23 BCE), Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em> (18 BCE), and Ovid’s <em>Metamorophoses</em>
          (8 CE) in juxtaposition to that of Augustus’ own <em>Res Gestae</em> (14 CE).
          In order to tease out the subtle nuances of this sophisticated discourse
          in the space provided by a dissertation-length study I will be examining
          closely these texts themselves. I will therefore not be providing an
          in-depth architectural analysis of any physical monumental structure in
          Rome. This does not mean that I believe the physical environment of the
          city was at all irrelevant to how and why the Augustan poets built their
          poetic <em>monumenta</em>. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid – these three authors
          experienced first-hand the transformation of Rome into a city of marble
          monuments during the span of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> It is not
          surprising, then, that they might turn to monumental architecture as the
          signifier with which to express something about their own
          “constructions.” What I want to emphasize again is that my focus will be
          on how real and poetic monuments are discussed – and to what ends – by
          Augustus and the poets of his age. These poets and their <em>princeps</em> were
          all tapping into the common language which monumental discourse supplied
          when they articulated what made their works monumental. And it is that
          discourse which is in much greater need of scholarly attention than the
          physical structures themselves.</p>
          
          <p>I will begin my analysis of Roman architexture in Chapter III with
          Horace’s lyrical <em>Odes</em>. After consistently making claims that one
          should aim for the “golden mean” (<em>aurea mediocritas</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.10.5) and
          outwardly lamenting the excesses of contemporary architecture,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> the
          poet appears to make a remarkable “about-face” at the end of his first
          publication of the collection. In the final poem, <em>C</em>. 3.30, Horace
          claims to have built a <em>monumentum</em> that will not only be higher than
          the pyramids but which will even escape the grasp of decaying time
          itself. I will argue that this apparent contradiction between the
          content of his lyric and the “form” which he ultimately gives it is
          anticipated throughout the <em>Odes</em> by a type of rhetorical disavowal –
          what I term an “inverted” <em>recusatio</em> – that allows the poet to
          incorporate into his lyric structure that which he claims to
          exclude.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> By using this rhetorical device to establish a delicate
          though perfect balance of tensions Horace can erect a dynamic and
          innovative “monument” of lyric poetry while – or rather <em>through</em> –
          claiming to be “traditional.” This method of innovating without
          destabilizing the structure of the tradition will then be compared to
          the strategies that Augustus used when discussing his own buildings in
          the <em>Res Gestae</em>. Both poet and <em>princeps</em>, I will suggest, use the idea
          of a stable structure provided by monuments to balance present
          innovations against past traditions – generic for the one, social and
          political for the other.</p>
          
          <p>The subsequent analysis of Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em> in Chapters IV-V will
          likewise examine what the epic poet has to say about architecture and
          monuments in the poem before then turning to how he might be fashioning
          his poem itself as a <em>monumentum</em>. Because of the epic’s size it will be
          necessary to break up the analysis of its architexture into two separate
          chapters. Chapter IV will treat two of the most common and significant
          architectural tropes of the poem, artificial caves and deceptive
          labyrinths, as they demonstrate a very different focus on the part of
          the poet from what can be found in the <em>Odes</em>. The disruptive forces of
          Vergil’s poem are not external, but rather are shown to have been
          trapped <em>inside</em> these grand structures. As we will see, however,
          despite their size and divine craftsmanship these constructions are
          shown to “fail” again and again – thereby releasing the violent forces
          of Rome’s past contained within them.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Chapter V will then focus in
          particular on the epic’s <em>monumenta</em> – including the ones that Anchises
          (mis)remembers while on Crete, the ones found on Doors of Daedalus in
          the form of the Minotaur, the ones in the environs of pre-Rome, and the
          multiple ones that the baldric of Pallas may represent<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> – before
          turning to how they all can help us to understand the poem itself as a
          kind of <em>monumentum</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Taken together Chapters IV and V will examine the way that Vergil’s
          architexture is less about keeping out those external forces which could
          disrupt the <em>status quo</em> than about the chaos and violence of Rome’s
          past – distant and very recent – that the poem-as-monument tries to
          contain within its magnificent epic surface. What I aim to do in these
          two chapters is to explore how Vergil is engaging with the monumental
          discourse of Augustan Rome through a poem whose surface might be as
          resplendent as a Roman temple, but whose interior hides a chaotic force
          that should not be forgotten lest it break free and cause the past to
          repeat itself. A return to the <em>Res Gestae</em> at the end of Chapter V will
          set in further relief how Augustus dealt in his own monumental discourse
          with the <em>furor</em> and chaos of Rome’s past which he too needed to contain
          when attempting to construct a new Roman <em>constitutio</em>.</p>
          
          <p>In Chapter VI, as the dissertation itself approaches its end, I will
          then examine the conclusion of another “epic” poem, Ovid’s
          <em>Metamorphoses</em>, to see how a poet writing at the far end of the
          Augustan age further explores the ideas of stability and instability in
          the monumental edifices examined in Horatian lyric and Vergilian epic,
          respectively. The metaphor of a poem as a <em>monumentum</em> may have begun to
          run its course as something fresh and dynamic by the conclusion of the
          Augustan age. As I will argue, however, Ovid’s poem represents not the
          dying of this architectural metaphor but rather its evolution to reflect
          the way in which Augustus himself had re-arranged the boundaries which
          had structured Roman space and Roman identity during Rome’s rise to
          power. The late Augustan poet concludes his <em>Metamorphoses</em> as Horace
          does in his <em>Odes</em>, namely, by claiming that he too has constructed a
          monument.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Ovid’s structure is rather different from that of his
          Augustan predecessor, however. Like the content of his poem itself, in
          fact, the monument that Ovid has constructed seems to transcend its own
          boundaries, that is, to become a structure without a structure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> I
          argue that this transcendence of structure mirrors the way that the
          boundaries between public and private space also fade away in the final
          chapter of <em>Res Gestae</em>. It might be, in fact, that the most important
          “construction” that Augustus completed was not just to build a new <em>res
          publica</em> without destabilizing the foundations of the past, as Horace
          does with his <em>monumentum</em>. Nor was it to give a frame to a new
          understanding of what it meant to be Roman while keeping the horrors of
          the past present, as Vergil accomplishes in his poem. Even more
          important perhaps was how the <em>princeps</em> carefully articulated his own
          constructions in the <em>Res Gestae</em> as a means of radically renegotiating
          the boundaries between his property and that of the state.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>My conclusion in Chapter VII will look to the broader consequences of
          what an analysis of this “dialogue” between the poets and <em>princeps</em> can
          teach us about monumentality today. I will provide a brief survey of the
          idea of the monument in modernity in order to show by way of contrast
          that the various ways which the Romans embraced the dual nature of
          monuments to be both stable and unstable might just provide a more
          productive alternative to the at times rather limiting discourse
          surrounding modern monumentality.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Let us now return for a moment, though, to the words that began this
          introduction: “I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as
          a city of brick.” This boast is more nuanced than it might first appear.
          The <em>princeps</em> is not claiming to have knocked down Rome and replaced it
          with something new. Even if the material is different, the <em>structure</em>
          is importantly still the same. Rome is still Rome – and its ancient
          foundations lie untouched. This is not by chance. Augustus was
          incredibly careful with his use of monumental discourse to articulate
          the Rome that he (re-)constructed. And this dissertation will attempt to
          suggest why.</p>

          The twentieth-century architectural theorist Sigfried Giedion (1949,
          646-647) would even go so far as to say that “[w]e do not doubt
          that in some periods there has existed a unity of culture. In those
          periods imagination and the external world flowed into one another.
          Then the spirit was not condemned to go its way alone, and reality
          had not the single meaning of struggle for existence. Those were the
          happy hours of mankind, but they have been rare and of tragic
          brevity. […] [S]o it was in Rome during the lustrous reign of
          Augustus. […] These periods, with their unity of intellectual,

          range from speeches to “buildings, monuments, coins, altars, and

          from Herodotus to Pausanias, the approach most similar to mine can
          be found in Fowler 2000, 193-219. His discussion of the very thin

                <p>The idea that architectural discourse was an important one in late
          republican and Augustan literature is by no means novel. Mazzolini
          1970, Ceauṣescu 1976, and Labate 1991 each treats the impact that
          the idea of Rome as a city had on Roman thought. F. R. Brown 1963,
          Gros 1991, Callebat 1994, Caye 2011, and now Elsner and Meyer 2014,

          Whereas Edwards 1996 present the “Romes” that texts of several eras
          have fashioned, Reitz 2013 argues “that describing the process of
          (architectural) construction within a literary text can also be a
          way of encouraging the reader to consider the (literary)
          construction of the text itself” (8). Moreover, several excellent
          and detailed studies have attempted to find meaning in architecture
          that goes beyond the physical structures within the works of Cicero,
          Livy, and Vitruvius, including Vasaly 1993, on Cicero’s manipulation
          of monuments in his oratory, Jaegar 1997, on how Livy uses monuments

          Augustus’ temple of Palatine Apollo (in addition to Propertius’

          private into the public (and <em>vice versa</em>) through the imperial
          <em>domus</em>. See also Wiseman 1987, Eck 1997, and Wallace-Hadrill 2008
          for more discussion of the renegotiation of the boundaries of public

                <p>The bibliography on the idea of the monument in modern thought is
          immense and varied. Some of the most influential works include: Hugo
          1831, Ruskin 1849, Nietzsche 1874, Riegl 1903, Mumford 1937, Barthes
          1964, Le Goff 1978, North 1985, Nora 1989, Hung 1995, Choay 2001,
          Carpo 2007, and Frichot 2011. A variety of different perspectives on
          the topic can also be found in the special edition of <em>World
          Archaeology</em>, “Monuments and the Monumental” (22.2: 1990), as well
          as in Nelson and Olin 2003, which is an edited volume with
          contributions from leading scholars on monumentality in various
          fields, including classical studies. <a href="#fnref:29" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
