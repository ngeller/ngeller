      </header>
      <article class='page'>
        <main class='page-content'>
          <p>The Augustan age provides a particularly useful lens through which to
          examine the idea of the monument. It represented a relatively short
          period of time in which Romans witnessed the monumental make-over of
          their city, their government, and even what it meant to be Roman.
          Building was on the minds of many Romans during Augustus’ reign. The
          poets and writers of the period are famous for constru(ct)ing their
          works as buildings or monuments of some sort. Livy and Horace have their
          own <em>monumenta</em>. Vergil his <em>templum</em>. Ovid has his <em>opus</em>. Might
          Augustus have thought of his work in Rome in such architectural terms?
          …<em>rei publicae constituendae</em>…<sup id="fnref:475"><a href="#fn:475" class="footnote">1</a></sup> That was the task that Augustus
          took up when he first came into power. He did not do it alone, though.
          There were also the Augustan poets who contributed to his
          monumentalization of Rome with their own <em>monumenta</em> – poets who helped
          Romans to become better readers of the structures around them, both
          physical and metaphorical.</p>
          
          <p>To conclude this dissertation I will now turn to the situation of the
          monument in modernity. By outlining some of the ways that the idea of
          the monument has been viewed in modern times I hope demonstrate by way
          of contrast just how productive the Roman understanding of monumentality
          was in Augustan Rome. The below rather concise history of monumentality
          in modernity is not the only story that one could tell about the idea of
          the monument in the 18<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries. It is a cursory review,
          not a comprehensive study, and several important players and moments in
          the debate simply had to be left out for the sake of concision. My aim
          in looking now at more recent times is rather to demonstrate how the
          concept of monumentality in the Augustan age was a fruitful response to
          some of the same issues which we deal with today when we think of the
          structures around us – both in our physical reality and in the way they
          help us to frame how we see the world in which we live.</p>
          
          <p>“The Death of the Monument.” With this bold title Lewis Mumford famously
          announced the fall of monumental architecture in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.
          What was the cause of its demise? Death by “contradiction.” That was
          Mumford’s initial diagnosis, at least.<sup id="fnref:476"><a href="#fn:476" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The idea of the monument –
          an object “oriented toward death and fixity” – simply did not fit any
          conception of modern architecture, which for Mumford stressed “life and
          change.”<sup id="fnref:477"><a href="#fn:477" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The very stone materials that had so long been endowed
          with “a metaphysical belief in fixity and immortality” now became
          dangerous “encumbrances” in Mumford’s eyes: monumental structures
          “stifle the possibilities of adaptation, movement and effective
          improvement” – and for that reason, Mumford warned, they might even
          bring about civilization’s “ultimate downfall.”<sup id="fnref:478"><a href="#fn:478" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This was not the first time that the death knell had sounded for the
          monument. Nor would it be the last. The monument had died and would
          continue to “die” in modern thought – whether as a symbol of past
          traditions, as a physical structure erected to represent present powers,
          or as a metaphor operative in giving structure to the ways in which we
          think about thinking. This conclusion will examine three “deaths” of the
          modern monument in particular, each time with an eye to the different
          conclusions of this dissertation regarding the idea of the monument in
          Augustan Rome. Although the Romans faced some of the same issues with
          the nature of the monument, especially in regards to its physical and
          epistemological instability, this study has suggested that these
          anxieties did not lead to the collapse of the idea but rather its
          reconstruction – and with it the reconstruction of Roman society after
          years of civil strife and political disillusionment.</p>

          <p>“Let there be no mistake,” Victor Hugo wrote in his <em>Notre-Dame de
          Paris</em> (1831), “architecture is dead.”<sup id="fnref:479"><a href="#fn:479" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The culprit this time?
          Gutenburg’s printing press, according to Hugo, which had given everyone
          the ability to build (metaphorically) his or her own grand edifice of
          knowledge that the church and palace had once represented.<sup id="fnref:480"><a href="#fn:480" class="footnote">6</a></sup> As a
          result, it has been argued, grand architecture began to lose the
          symbolic authority that it had possessed when it was closely bound to
          the ideas of the sacred and the royal before finally dying with the fall
          of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> and the questioning of all the power structures
          that it had represented.<sup id="fnref:481"><a href="#fn:481" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The French Revolution had also stripped monuments of the ability to make
          material the binding structure of past authority. Indeed, while Henri
          Léonard Jean Baptiste Bertin (1720-1792) as Louis XV’s <em>contrôleur
          général des finances</em> wrote to his king that “[t]he history and public
          law of a nation are based on its monuments,”<sup id="fnref:482"><a href="#fn:482" class="footnote">8</a></sup> the aftermath of
          French Revolution with its wish to produce a radical break from the
          structures of the past produced a rather different attitude towards
          monuments: the past that grand architecture commemorated was a lost (and
          undesirable) past;<sup id="fnref:483"><a href="#fn:483" class="footnote">9</a></sup> it was rather the new needs of the present and
          future that monuments should address.<sup id="fnref:484"><a href="#fn:484" class="footnote">10</a></sup> And while there were
          certainly attempts by those like the English art critic, John Ruskin, to
          save the monuments of the past and the authority they could
          materialize,<sup id="fnref:485"><a href="#fn:485" class="footnote">11</a></sup> the ancient structures that did exist came to be seen
          with a more questioning eye by historians, even once the strong desire
          for “rupture” from the past had subsided.<sup id="fnref:486"><a href="#fn:486" class="footnote">12</a></sup> To Fustel de Coulanges
          at the end of the nineteenth century, for example, it was the “document”
          – and specifically <em>not</em> the “monument”– that became our tie to the
          “truth” of the past.<sup id="fnref:487"><a href="#fn:487" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Already in the nineteenth century, then, it is possible to detect a
          version of what Mumford would call a “distrust for the monumental”<sup id="fnref:488"><a href="#fn:488" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
          – not only in the inability of monuments to produce the same kind of awe
          that they once had done for the church and traditions of the past, but
          also in the failure of these structure to create for humanity a stable
          link to that past. The collapse of the power structures of church and
          state revealed what seemed to be a flaw in the nature of the monument,
          namely, its inability to endure once the link between it and the
          figurative structure of the state had been severed. Structures fade away
          over time. And those structures that had once been symbols of power were
          now symbols of that very power’s collapse.</p>
          
          <p>The Romans at the beginning of the Augustan age did not abandon the
          structures of their past, whether real or figurative; they rebuilt them,
          rather, despite the narrative of the Roman state’s “collapse” at the end
          of the republic, as voiced in authors such as Livy and Horace.<sup id="fnref:489"><a href="#fn:489" class="footnote">15</a></sup>
          These new structures were built upon past foundations, so to speak, but
          used the stability offered by monumentality to balance innovations
          against the previous structures of Rome’s history. Horace did this with
          his <em>Odes</em> by constructing a poetic <em>monumentum</em> that was lyric but also
          incorporated forces that might seem to upset its generic framework. In
          this way, as I argued in Chapter III, the poet crafted a work whose
          generic tensions allowed for a constantly dynamic structure that was at
          once traditional and innovative – one that would breathe new life into
          an old structure. Augustus in his <em>Res Gestae</em> also employed a similar
          rhetorical strategy in describing his own building activities to
          articulate the novel kind of power that he had fashioned for himself
          without destabilizing the traditional boundaries of Rome’s political and
          cultural past. It was just as much in downplaying the radical nature of
          his works as in stressing their magnificence that allowed the emperor to
          incorporate new ideas and structures within traditional republican
          boundaries without seeming to break them down even further. Neither
          Horace nor Augustus shied away from employing the power of monuments –
          and the idea of a dynamic structure that they provide – even at a time
          when the old monuments of Rome that represented the <em>res publica</em> were
          in ruin. In short, both the poet and the <em>princeps</em> saw the advantages
          to employing such structures of the past, if only because it allowed
          them to articulate delicately the innovations which they made to those
          structures’ traditional frames.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2-the-second-death-shaking-the-foundations-of-present-authority">Part 2. The Second “Death”: Shaking the Foundations of Present Authority</h3>
          
          <p>Let us return briefly now to Mumford and his autopsy of the monument’s
          “corpse.” A closer look at his essay reveals that modernism was not the
          sole cause of death. “[E]very stone has become ironic to us,” Mumford
          noted. “[T]ime is a bomb that will split the most august temple open,
          if the wanton savagery of men’s swifter bombs does not anticipate
          time.”<sup id="fnref:490"><a href="#fn:490" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Faith in present monuments still did exist for the moment,
          though, as the ability to create secular monuments fell to the people of
          the French Revolution and its aftermath. However, the doubt that had
          adhered to monuments of the past eventually – and in a certain sense
          inevitably – also began to enter into people’s thoughts concerning
          monuments of their present, as well as those of their future. In the
          aftermath of one World War and at the cusp of yet another there was a
          certain awareness of the fragility of mankind’s affairs and structures.
          And this “distrust for the monumental,” as Mumford put it, would only
          increase following WWII when the atrocities of that war produced
          monuments that “stopped celebrating great deeds, as their specialty
          [was] to register grave errors.”<sup id="fnref:491"><a href="#fn:491" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>A transformation of the monumental to commemorate what one might wish
          had never happened was not the only blow to the West’s faith in
          monumentality that WWII delivered. The grand building projects of
          Mussolini and Hitler each left their own impact on the idea of the
          monument. The desire of <em>Il Duce</em> to remake Rome “vast, ordered,
          powerful, as it was in the time of the first empire of Augustus,” had
          led to several monumental building projects in Rome that integrated or
          directly called upon Roman monuments in an attempt to capitalize on the
          imperial monumentality of the Augustan age itself.<sup id="fnref:492"><a href="#fn:492" class="footnote">18</a></sup> There was the
          dangerous belief among Mussolini’s followers, moreover, that these
          projects legitimated his plans for domination of the
          Mediterranean.<sup id="fnref:493"><a href="#fn:493" class="footnote">19</a></sup> The Italian art historian Gustavo Giovannini would
          go so far as to proclaim that “[w]hile the Empire returns to the fated
          hills of Rome and new glories join themselves with the ancient ones,
          from our hearts comes the vow that architecture of the Fascist times
          will resume – in the return to our grand tradition – the path of
          domination which was that of the past.”<sup id="fnref:494"><a href="#fn:494" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Yet this was all relatively tame compared to the vast (and utterly
          intrusive) building programs that Hitler was planning in Northern
          Europe.<sup id="fnref:495"><a href="#fn:495" class="footnote">21</a></sup> To reclaim the monuments and monumentality of imperial
          Rome for his own use was not so easy a task in Germany as it was for
          Mussolini in Rome. Hitler’s strategy had to be different. As the famous
          German architectural theorist Léon Krier would later say, Hitler sought
          not merely to “copy historic styles, but to create a new style which was
          itself to become historical” – one that far surpassed the “coarse
          Latinism of Italian Fascism.”<sup id="fnref:496"><a href="#fn:496" class="footnote">22</a></sup> The goal was not imitation of Roman
          monumental architecture, <em>per se</em>, but of its high degree of sheer
          monumentality.<sup id="fnref:497"><a href="#fn:497" class="footnote">23</a></sup> “[I]t was gigantic proportions,” then, and “not
          purity of style, that interested Hitler.”<sup id="fnref:498"><a href="#fn:498" class="footnote">24</a></sup> More importantly,
          though, it was an obsession with using his buildings to create a message
          that would – according to his chief architect Albert Speer – “deliver
          his time and its spirit to posterity.”<sup id="fnref:499"><a href="#fn:499" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It would have no doubt been enough to make people wary of monuments if
          Mussolini and Hitler had succeeded in their architectural
          endeavors.<sup id="fnref:500"><a href="#fn:500" class="footnote">26</a></sup> The fact that they failed, however, that their
          buildings and building projects came to be judged as “colossal
          mistakes,”<sup id="fnref:501"><a href="#fn:501" class="footnote">27</a></sup> would create a further distrust in the idea of the
          monument by reinforcing the emptiness, fragility, and instability of the
          meaning of monuments both ancient and modern. Just consider, for
          instance, whether there could ever be another Lincoln Memorial in
          America, or another face added to Mt. Rushmore. No matter how great a
          president might be, I would argue, the very idea of erecting such a
          monument to him or her has become almost inconceivable today.</p>
          
          <p>As Chapters IV and V demonstrated, however, the “failure” of a monument
          to maintain a single, triumphant narrative can be just as useful as its
          success for making a viewer think about the past and its relation to him
          or her. Vergil again and again show the inability of monuments, whether
          old or new, to serve as epistemological ballasts. However, the ability
          of a monument to have multiple meanings does not necessarily render it
          any less useful – whether for the poet or Augustus himself. For the
          Augustan peace to have its full significance, I argued above, it was
          necessary for Romans to see beyond the monumental frame of their city to
          the chaotic past that existed beneath the marble facade. <em>Furor</em> had
          been bound and chained by Augustus, it is true, but that did mean it was
          gone forever. And Augustus needed his subjects to remember that, too.
          Vergil helps to craft readers who can appreciate the beauty and
          magnificence of the surface of Augustan monuments while remembering the
          violent and chaotic past that such monuments try to frame and contain.
          Far from “deconstructing” the positive message of a monumental structure
          both Vergil and Augustus used the epistemological “failure” of monuments
          to establish an even deeper appreciation of the new and improved present
          within the Roman imagination.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-3-the-third-death-the-collapse-of-the-monumental-metaphor">Part 3. The Third “Death”: The Collapse of the Monumental Metaphor</h3>
          
          <p>The idea of the monument was first killed in modernity when the
          loosening of authority that the printing press had set in motion began
          to shatter the power structures of the past (as well as the monuments
          that materialized them) in the revolutionary air of the late eighteenth
          century. It was at this time, however, that the idea of monument was
          reborn as a monumentality geared to the present and future – only to die
          again, though, when its stability (physical and epistemological) was
          revealed to be a farce by the World Wars that shook humanity to its
          foundations.<sup id="fnref:502"><a href="#fn:502" class="footnote">28</a></sup> It was not long afterwards that Roland Barthes would
          write in his important essay on <em>La Tour Eiffel</em> (1964) that the famous
          French edifice was an “empty monument” (<em>monument vide</em>) – one that was
          “impossible to escape, <em>because it means everything”</em> and yet also
          “<em>nothing</em>” in that “it achieves a kind of zero degree of the
          monument.”<sup id="fnref:503"><a href="#fn:503" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Such a point had been reached, in other words, when the
          physical monument which had once been the chief symbol of humanity for
          representing authority past and present was now a representation of the
          problems with representing any idea – including not least of all
          representation itself.</p>
          
          <p>The possibility of an “empty” monument that Barthes raised has
          additional significance for the discussion of modern monumentality. The
          monument was not just an important signifier for the traditions of the
          past and power structures of the present; it had been from the start
          perhaps one of the fundamental metaphors for “thinking about thinking”
          in the West.<sup id="fnref:504"><a href="#fn:504" class="footnote">30</a></sup> The above narrative regarding the “death” of physical
          monuments runs parallel to another history concerning the demise of
          metaphorical ones in the context of (the aptly named) post-structuralism
          and, in particular, the theories and practices of deconstruction.</p>
          
          <p>Majestic architecture had always been – in the words of Hugo – the
          “grand book of humanity.”<sup id="fnref:505"><a href="#fn:505" class="footnote">31</a></sup> A strange thing happened, though, when
          the physical monument began to lose its power as the Ur-symbol, as
          discussed above with its first two “deaths.”<sup id="fnref:506"><a href="#fn:506" class="footnote">32</a></sup> If anything, in fact,
          losing its physical nature seems to have allowed the architectural
          monument to gain additional power as a metaphor. Just at the point when
          architecture ceased to be the universal text of humanity in Hugo’s text,
          for instance, text became humanity’s universal architecture.<sup id="fnref:507"><a href="#fn:507" class="footnote">33</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Hugo was not alone in carrying the discourse surrounding architecture
          and monuments into the text. Kant had already erected his famous
          “edifice of metaphysics” in the <em>Kritik der Urteilskraft</em> near the very
          start of the French Revolution in 1790.<sup id="fnref:508"><a href="#fn:508" class="footnote">34</a></sup> As this transformation
          continued, moreover, the removal of the monument from history (and
          historiography) proved harder than Fustel de Coulanges and others would
          have liked. Nietzsche would claim that we need a sense of the
          “monumental” in our history – despite its many dangers<sup id="fnref:509"><a href="#fn:509" class="footnote">35</a></sup> – if we are
          to learn anything at all from the past and not be severed from it
          entirely.<sup id="fnref:510"><a href="#fn:510" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Foucault writing over a hundred years afterwards might
          have put it best, though, when he noted that whereas history used to
          turn monuments into documents the opposite had occurred in his own time:
          historians now make documents into monuments.<sup id="fnref:511"><a href="#fn:511" class="footnote">37</a></sup> It had become clear,
          in other words, that documents of the past are in essence fashioned just
          like monuments – and thereby are open to the same dangers of
          interpretation.<sup id="fnref:512"><a href="#fn:512" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It might not be a coincidence, then, that it was
          in this particular intellectual milieu in which Barthes and Foucault
          were writing – when the monument had died, lost the power of its
          materiality, and been reborn in the text – that post-structuralism came
          to prominence.</p>
          
          <p>The monument would “die” once again in this context, of course. The
          executioner this time would be none other than the theories and
          practices of deconstruction. The transformation of the monument from a
          physical building in reality into a metaphorical one in the text had
          left the latter vulnerable to the same instabilities that had been noted
          in the former. Kant’s worst anxieties thus came to fruition: the
          foundations of his edifice of metaphysics were seen to be just as
          susceptible to failure as any real building – and with their cracking
          would come “the collapse of the whole structure.”<sup id="fnref:513"><a href="#fn:513" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Indeed, as the
          Japanese cultural critic Kojin Karatani would put it, the desire of Kant
          (and much Western philosophy) “‘to construct a solid edifice’ ultimately
          does not achieve a foundation, but reveals instead the very absence of
          its own foundation.”<sup id="fnref:514"><a href="#fn:514" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Western thought cannot but undermine itself,
          according to Karatani, as the very will “to establish order and
          structure within a chaotic and manifold becoming” betrays the fact that
          the order is not only constructed, but also subject to collapsing back
          into the chaos it masks.<sup id="fnref:515"><a href="#fn:515" class="footnote">41</a></sup> It would seem, in fact, that this third
          death of the monument – that is, the collapse of the grand metaphorical
          edifice of Western philosophy which was supposed to provide stability
          and fixity for all thought – was perhaps not an insignificant factor for
          the strength of deconstructive discourse itself over the past few
          decades.</p>
          
          <p>This modern response is one way to come to grips with the
          acknowledgement that monuments are inherently unstable, as physical
          structures and as metaphors. But what if one decided to embrace fully
          the malleability of meaning inherent to the structural metaphor of a
          monument? What if one used that same instability to enlist one’s
          audience in validating and stabilizing that new structure whatever it
          may be? Would that not allow one to erect something that can transcend
          the traditional boundaries that limit one’s potential to create
          something new and innovative? Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> perhaps gives us an
          answer to these sorts of questions. The very lack of structure in his
          architextural monument allows him at the end of his text to craft a poem
          that achieves its power not by establishing a solid edifice; the power
          of the <em>Metamorphoses</em> lies rather in the way that it asks its audience
          to establish firmly the open and ever-changing nature of the work. It
          was by these means, as Chapter VI suggested, that Ovid could make his
          private self a permanent part of the public consciousness and transcend
          the physical limits of his body – all while also helping to shape
          through his poem how the Roman public understood what it now meant to be
          Roman in a new age. Augustus’ monumentalization of Rome represented a
          similar response to the opening up of boundaries that his reign had
          produced: the <em>princeps</em> at the end of his <em>Res Gestae</em> broke down and
          reconstructed the republican boundaries of private and public in such a
          way that he too could have his subjects themselves become partners in
          establishing a new frame for structuring Rome and Roman identity.
          Neither poet nor <em>princeps</em> might have been quite so successful, though,
          if each had not embraced the inherent epistemological instability of
          architectural discourse when articulating how they had reshaped Roman
          space and through it Roman identity. They were not afraid to let their
          audiences give the final meaning to their monuments; in fact, that very
          well may have been the secret to their subsequent immortality.</p>
          
          <p>***</p>
          
          <p>“Remember the impression of good architecture, that it expresses a
          thought,” Ludwig Wittgenstein once wrote. “You want to respond to it
          with a gesture.”<sup id="fnref:516"><a href="#fn:516" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Augustus might have opened up the dialogue by
          making Rome a city of marble. He needed people who could “respond” to
          him, however, especially since the meaning of his monumental structures
          and their relation to what it meant to be Roman was often far from
          unambiguous. Nor could they be otherwise when the <em>princeps</em> had to be
          careful to establish his new Rome upon what Rome had been – both in good
          times and bad. The Augustan poets in turn investigated the monumentality
          of their age through their own monumental poems. This dissertation has
          suggested that their <em>monumenta</em> entered into a dialogue with the
          monumentalization of their city, shaping it and being shaped by it. They
          not only built monuments that would last even longer than that of the
          <em>princeps</em>; more than that, the self-reflective nature of their
          monuments made explicit the assumptions of the dialogue itself – and
          thus opened it up as a dialogue in which any Roman reader could
          critically engage.</p>
          
          <p>What about those readers? The Roman people themselves played an
          essential part in responding to the architectural gestures of the
          <em>princeps</em> and thereby giving meaning to the structures of their
          existence. And in closing this dissertation I want to look at <em>this</em>
          dialogue in the context of one final architextural passage – this time
          from Augustus himself. In an edict recorded by Suetonius, the <em>princeps</em>
          claimed:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Ita mihi <strong>salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere in sua sede</strong> liceat
          atque eius rei fructum percipere, quem peto, ut <strong>optimi status auctor
          dicar</strong> et moriens ut feram mecum spem, <strong>mansura in vestigio suo
          fundamenta rei p. quae iecero</strong>. (<em>Div</em>. <em>Aug</em>. 28.2)<sup id="fnref:517"><a href="#fn:517" class="footnote">43</a></sup></p>
          
            <p>May it thus be permitted for me <strong>to establish in its place the <em>res
          publica</em> securely and soundly</strong>, and to reap from that action the
          fruit that I seek, on the condition that <strong>I may be called</strong> <strong>the
          architect of the best state</strong>, and that when I die I may carry with me
          the hope that <strong>the foundations of the <em>res publica</em> which I have set
          will remain in its position</strong>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Suetonius adds that Augustus “himself granted his own wish by striving
          in every way that there be no dissatisfaction with the new state”
          (<em>fecitque ipse se compotem voti nisus omni modo, ne quem novi status
          paeniteret</em>, <em>Div. Aug</em>. 28.2). Although Suetonius might be right here
          about the political situation, his interpretation completely misses the
          importance of the architectural metaphors at play in Augustus’ statement
          (cf. <em>salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere</em> <em>in sua sede … mansura in
          vestigio suo fundamenta rei p. quae iecero</em>). Architectural meaning
          cannot be established by a top-down approach – neither in the case of
          physical buildings nor with the structure of the <em>res publica</em> itself.
          Augustus seems to have understood that notion better than the average
          leader, whether in antiquity or today. And it was in allowing the Roman
          people to be a part of the dialogue that monumental architecture opens
          up – whether in stone or in word – that was just as important to making
          sure he would in fact be called the “architect of the best state”
          (<em>optimi status auctor dicar</em>) by his subjects.<sup id="fnref:518"><a href="#fn:518" class="footnote">44</a></sup> For it was by
          leaving it to the Romans themselves to validate the new <em>status</em> that
          the <em>princeps</em> could ensure his monument of the city itself (and what it
          now meant) would remain standing in place long after he had died.</p>
          
          <p>It was much to Augustus’ advantage, then, that there were contemporary
          poets whose self-reflective <em>monumenta</em> could provide lessons in the
          nature of monumentality. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid each brought out
          different aspects of monumentality, its weaknesses as well as its
          strengths, with the understanding that monuments were structures which
          were inherently (and paradoxically) both stable and unstable,
          epistemologically and much as physically. This was not a harsh critique
          of what Augustus was doing in reality. Nor was it merely a game, either,
          that paralleled a loss of faith in the meaning of structures that had
          framed Roman existence in the aftermath of the republic’s supposed
          “collapse.” It was rather in part because of these poets that the Roman
          people could fully understand why the monumental <em>constitutio</em> that
          Augustus had built was the best that Rome had ever seen – and, even more
          importantly, that it ultimately could not stand for very long without
          their consent.</p>

          its “walls.” See also Choay 2001, 8, claiming that “[t]he memorial

          “[a]rchitecture had benefited from an embodied and memorable
          legacy when it was centered around a sacred model, but with the
          Enlightenment a great many new models evolved; palaces and churches
          had to compete for architectural eminence with a range of secular
          building types.” Crossley 1998, 175, discusses the structure of the
          medieval church as the embodiment of “moral education,” as well as
          “the internal and ordered theatre for the workings of the intellect,
          the memory or the soul.” See also Olsen 1986, 289, arguing that
          monumentality had survived the new “religion” of capitalism (which
          should have looked down on excessive expenditures) precisely because
          “[w]hat had once been the peculiar privilege of the spiritual and
          secular masters of society became a universal indulgence.” This
          evolution of the monumental was also noted in Marx and Engels 1848

          greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, nor in its gold.
          Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of
          stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or
          condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by
          the passing waves of humanity.” Ruskin was famously against any sort
          of intervention in one’s experience of monuments of the past; for
          him, even restoration was to be viewed with contempt. It is
          important to note, however, that Ruskin should be seen as reacting
          to the changes of his time more than necessarily a representative
          figure of them more generally. <a href="#fnref:485" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>Le Goff 1978 provides a concise narrative of this evolution from
          monument to document and then back to monument. See also Morley 2011
          for an examination of Nietzsche and Foucault’s use of
          “monumentality” and, in general, the “constant possibility [of
          monumentality] in all historiography” that historians need to
          acknowledge even as they deny its presence (226). <a href="#fnref:512" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>Karatani 1995, 8. See also Wigley 1993, 7, arguing that
          “metaphysics is no more than the attempt to locate the ground” – a
          “ground” which does not exist, <em>per se</em>, but arises from the
          assumption of philosophy that there is something under its
          foundations. This line of thought – as Wigley 1993, 39, points out –
          has its roots in Heidegger’s 1953 work <em>Introduction to Metaphysics</em>
          (<em>Einführung in die Metaphysik</em>), where the German philosopher
          “raises the possibility that the ground (<em>Grund</em>) might actually be
          a concealed ‘abyss’ (<em>Abgrund</em>) and that metaphysics is constructed
          in ignorance of, or rather, to ignore, the instability of the
          terrain on which it is erected, such that ‘we move about over this
          ground as over a flimsily covered abyss.’” <a href="#fnref:514" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
