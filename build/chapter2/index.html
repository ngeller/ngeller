          <p>Two bronze columns were placed in front of Augustus’ Mausoleum at Rome
          after the death of the <em>princeps</em> in 14 CE. These columns were inscribed
          with a text describing the “<em>Res Gestae</em> of the Divine Augustus”
          (<em>RGDA</em>).<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The prose of the inscription was relatively “simple” and
          full of officialese phrases that some scholars would suggest provide
          very little insight into how Augustus actually viewed his
          achievements.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Others see the text as “a complex and allusive
          document, addressed to many audiences and with many levels of
          meaning.”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">3</a></sup> No matter what way one decides to read the <em>Res Gestae</em>,
          though, it still represents perhaps the most definitive statement that
          exists of how Augustus framed his work at Rome for posterity.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">4</a></sup> It is
          truly a monument both of and to the Augustan age.</p>
          
          <p>This dissertation argues that the <em>Res Gestae</em> is also a text whose
          monumentality needs be understood within the context of other literary
          monuments of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The <em>RGDA</em> demonstrates how Augustus
          used architecture – as much in his language as in the landscape of the
          city – to redefine the way his subjects would see their restored <em>res
          publica</em> on a continuum from Rome’s humble beginnings to its “collapse”
          at the end of the republic and finally to its monumental transformation
          under Augustus.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">6</a></sup> But this monumentalization of Rome in the Roman
          imagination was by no means the project of the <em>princeps</em> alone. Horace,
          Vergil, and Ovid each added “monuments” of their own which would
          anticipate the different ways in the <em>Res Gestae</em> that Augustus himself
          would articulate his reconstruction of Rome – both as a city and as an
          idea. Subsequent chapters will look in particular at how these three
          poets of the Augustan age both critiqued and contributed to a
          metaphorical transformation of Rome from crumbling brick to monumental
          marble in the Roman imagination as much as in its physical reality.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>To examine this shared project of the <em>princeps</em> and the Augustan poets
          it will first be necessary to understand how each of them negotiated his
          position from within the Roman tradition of viewing their world
          architecturally. The current chapter will outline some aspects of this
          tradition by briefly analyzing a few of the ways that architecture
          helped to determine how the Romans structured their reality
          conceptually.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">8</a></sup> I will begin in Part 1 by analyzing the fundamental
          link between architecture and order (political and otherwise) in
          Vitruvius’ <em>De architectura</em>. Part 2 will then look at architecture’s
          essential role in the Roman “art of memory” (<em>ars memoriae</em>). In Part 3
          the ideas of the preceding two sections will be applied to exploring the
          concept of Roman monumentality, with particular attention to how
          “monuments” (<em>monumenta</em>) provided an opportunity for Romans both to
          remember their past and critically examine how it fit within their
          present. This survey will end by then turning in Parts 4 and 5 to how
          two Romans – the historian Livy and Augustus himself – used a common
          language of monumental architecture at the beginning of their respective
          texts to represent the work they did to help “rebuild” Rome after the
          supposed “collapse” of both the <em>res publica</em> and the <em>mores</em> upon which
          it was founded.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This survey is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of the
          role of architecture in the Roman imagination. Several of the topics and
          texts touched upon here have been the subjects of much more thorough
          studies. My purpose in this chapter is rather to build upon the work of
          other scholars in order to provide a framework through which we might
          contextualize how Augustan age poets fashioned their poetic <em>monumenta</em>
          as contributions to the monumentalization of Rome. The point will be to
          establish the historical and literary milieu in which to examine why
          these poets fashioned their works as “monuments” in the first place, as
          well as to consider how we might understand Augustus’ collective work in
          Rome as an architectural <em>monumentum</em> in its own right.</p>
          
          <p>Later chapters will demonstrate how Augustus used architecture in his
          <em>Res Gestae</em> to redefine the traditional boundaries between past and
          present, between private and public, as well as those between Rome as a
          republic and Rome as his empire. He fashioned the city itself as a kind
          of “memory store,” I argue, one which all of its citizens could
          experience and use to define what it meant to be Roman in the Augustan
          age. The <em>princeps</em> did not just add new monuments to the city, in other
          words, but rather made Rome itself a monument, as he took what was a
          city of brick and left it one of marble.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">10</a></sup> The poets of this period
          used the idea of the monument, too, as a means of expanding, dissolving,
          and reconstituting the boundaries of their own poetry. This was not just
          in response to what Augustus was doing; the poets were actively in
          dialogue with Augustus’ monumentalization of the city, rather, and in
          such a way that their readers could then also better appreciate and
          evaluate what was happening to their Rome.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">11</a></sup> It is one of the main
          contentions of this dissertation, in fact, that we can better account
          for Augustus’ successful monumentalization of Rome by examining in
          parallel the “architexture” that several contemporary poets built in
          fashioning their works of literature as “monuments,” too.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">12</a></sup> And the
          purpose of this chapter is to show why it was monumental discourse in
          particular that served as the language through which Augustus and the
          poets of his age imagined their works.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-1-architecturally-speaking-the-imagery-of-vitruvius-de-architectura">Part 1. Architecturally Speaking: The Imagery of Vitruvius’ <em>De Architectura</em></h3>
          
          <p>Perhaps the most suitable place to start exploring the role that
          architecture played in how Romans structured the world around them
          conceptually would be with the only architectural treatise that survives
          intact from antiquity, namely, Vitruvius’ <em>De architectura</em>. The
          language that this late 1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE architect employed provides a
          useful window into the intersection of architectural and political
          discourse in the Roman imagination. It would seem that for Vitruvius the
          state could in a sense not exist without its architecture – whether in
          physical fact, or in even the language one uses to describe it.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">13</a></sup> It
          is through this discourse of monumental architecture that the architect
          made sense of what Augustus had done to the <em>res publica</em>’s physical and
          metaphorical foundations. And it should not be surprising, then, to find
          that Vitruvius’ language anticipates to a certain degree the <em>princeps</em>’
          own account of this transformation in the <em>Res Gestae</em> that will be
          examined at the end of this chapter, as well as throughout the rest of
          this dissertation.</p>
          
          <p>There is no passage in the treatise that better illustrates the
          architectural nature of this transformation than the preface addressed
          to Augustus himself. Vitruvius was quite aware of what the <em>princeps</em>
          had been doing to the physical appearance of Rome by the mid-20s BCE; in
          fact, that is why the architect claims to have written his treatise in
          the first place:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>cum uero adtenderem te non solum de uita communi omnium curam
          publicaeque rei <strong>constitutione</strong> habere, sed etiam de opportunitate
          publicorum aedificiorum ut civitas per te non solum prouinciis <strong>esset
          aucta</strong>, uerum etiam ut maiestas imperii publicorum aedificiorum
          egregias haberet auctoritates, non putaui praetermittendum quin primo
          quoque tempore de his rebus ea tibi ederem… (Vitr. Pr.2)<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>
          
            <p>When indeed I noticed the concern you had not only for the common life
          of all and the <strong>structure</strong> of the state but also concerning the
          opportunity for public buildings, so that the state would not simply
          <strong>be made greater</strong> by the acquisition of provinces, but that the
          majesty of the empire might also have the illustrious authority of
          public buildings, I thought I should not let pass the right
          opportunity to publish the following on these topics for you…”</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In the same preface Vitruvius adds that he has dedicated his treatise to
          Augustus because of what the <em>princeps</em> had done, was doing, and would
          do to the architectural landscape of Rome. “I began to write this for
          you,” the architect tells Augustus,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>quod animaduerti multa te aedificauisse et nunc aedificare, reliquo
          quoque tempore et publicorum et priuatorum aedificiorum, <strong>pro
          amplitudine</strong> rerum gestarum ut posteris <strong>memoriae</strong> traderentur
          curam habiturum… (Vitr. Pr.3)</p>
          
            <p>since I noticed that you had built and continue to build much, and
          that you would in your remaining time take care of both public and
          private buildings so that <strong>memorials</strong> would be passed down to
          posterity <strong>proportional to the size</strong> of your achievements…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>These two passages demonstrate the importance that Vitruvius believes
          Augustus attributed to architecture in Rome. In the first one, the
          architect relates that the <em>princeps</em> erected buildings which had
          “illustrious authority” (<em>egregias…auctoritates</em>) in order to ennoble
          the state – even on the same level as the acquisition of new
          territories. In the second, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that both
          public and private buildings could serve as memorials (<em>memoriae</em>) to
          the greatness of Augustus himself in the sense that they would reflect
          the magnitude (<em>amplitudo</em>) of his military and political achievements.
          As Kristina Milnor suggests, Vitruvius’ point here is “not simply that
          [Augustus] has built more, better, and bigger…but rather that he has
          revealed the ways in which architecture can mean something more than the
          construction of buildings.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>That is not the point of my analysis, however. What interests me in
          these passages is how the architectural <em>language</em> in them configures
          (and reconfigures) the relationship between architecture and the
          metaphorical structure of the Roman state. In the first passage,
          Vitruvius neatly parallels the “structure of the state” (<em>publicae rei
          constitutio</em>) with its public architecture (<em>publica aedificia</em>) through
          a <em>non solum…sed etiam</em> construction. Through the <em>ut</em>-clause expressing
          effort, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that the reason Augustus has been
          taking such good care of Rome’s metaphorical and physical <em>constitutio</em>
          is that the <em>princeps</em> himself is aware that the grandeur of the <em>res
          publica</em>’s physical appearance can affect and indeed amplify the majesty
          of its metaphorical greatness.</p>
          
          <p>The use of architectural metaphors for the state in republican Roman
          literature is not new, of course, as we will see below. What is striking
          here is how by the end of the second passage it would seem that those
          same sorts of architectural metaphors – and, in particular, the one
          regarding “size” – have come to represent something other than “the
          structure” of the republican state. In the first passage, it is the
          majesty of the state that can be metaphorically increased in size by
          Augustus’ deeds at home and abroad. In the second, however, the actual
          buildings of Augustus’ reign, both private and public, suddenly become
          <em>memoriae</em> for a new kind of metaphorical “structure” to be handed down
          to posterity. The sense of greatness that these new buildings evoke
          through their magnificent appearance is now proportional to the great
          “size” of Augustus’ own “accomplishments” (<em>pro amplitudine rerum
          gestarum</em>) – and no longer the greatness of state, as it was in the
          earlier passage.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The architectural language that Vitruvius employs thus allows the
          architect to stress the stability and structure that the <em>princeps</em> has
          restored to the Roman world – something architectural metaphors do quite
          well in general<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">17</a></sup> – while at the same time suggesting that a
          transformation has occurred between the old “structure” of the state and
          the new one under Augustus. In short, the <em>princeps</em> might be taking
          care of the “structure” of the <em>res publica</em>; by the end of the preface,
          however, that <em>constitutio</em> has been transformed from the old republican
          one to one of Augustus’ own construction that signifies <em>his</em> greatness,
          and no longer just the state’s.</p>

          <p>Vitruvius was an architect, of course, and he was writing about
          architecture. It should be noted, though, that seeing the state as a
          building was not uncommon in the context in which Vitruvius was
          building, writing, and thinking. At the very origins of Latin
          literature, for example, there is a fragment from the epic <em>Annales</em> of
          Ennius – famous already in antiquity, as quoted by Cicero at the start
          of Book V of the <em>De re publica</em> – which proclaims that “the Roman state
          is founded upon (<em>stat</em>) its <em>mores</em> and men of old.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Rome the city
          and Rome the institution went together to such an extent that the
          permanence and stability of its material buildings could even represent
          the structure and stability of the state itself, as Cicero is so eager
          to suggest of his own house in his <em>De domo sua</em>.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">19</a></sup> According to
          Alexander Demandt, in fact, “the stability of the masonry, the symmetry
          of the overall system, the subordination of all individual forms to the
          overall plan make the traits of the Roman political system
          architecturally visible.”<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">20</a></sup> That is not to say that Vitruvius should
          necessarily be taken as wholly representative of how all Romans
          <em>consciously</em> thought about the structure of their state (if such a
          thing is even possible to determine). What I would like to suggest is
          rather that we understand the architect’s work as a more explicit
          articulation of a deep connection that underlies the way that Romans saw
          the world around them – a connection not just between the physical and
          metaphorical idea of the Roman state, but more broadly between the idea
          of architecture and structure itself.</p>
          
          <p>A sequence of passages from the beginning of Book 2 of the <em>De
          architectura</em> will help to flesh out this connection further. According
          to Vitruvius, at least, the relationship between the architectural and
          political spheres starts at the very beginnings of civilization. It was
          the discovery of fire, Vitruvius tells us, which led to the near
          simultaneous invention of architecture, political associations, and even
          language:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>In eo hominum congressu cum profundebantur alitae e spiritu voces,
          cotidiana consuetudine <strong>uocabula</strong> ut optigerant <strong>constituerunt</strong>,
          deinde significando res saepius in usu ex eventu fari fortuito
          coeperunt, et ita sermones inter se procreauerunt. […] Ergo cum
          propter ignis inuentionem conuentus initio apud homines et concilium
          et conuictus esset natus…coeperunt in eo coetu alii de fronde facere
          tecta, alii speluncas fodere sub montibus, nonnulli hirundinum nidos
          et aedificationes earum imitantes de luto et uirgulis facere loca quae
          subirent. (Vitr. 2.1.1-2)</p>
          
            <p>In this gathering of people when voices were being poured forth
          supported by breath, <strong>they established words</strong>, as it so happened,
          from daily habit. They began then by chance in this way to speak more
          and more, signifying different objects from habit, and thus invented
          speech among themselves. […] Therefore when from the invention of
          fire the first meeting, assembly, and political association among
          humankind was born…from this gathering some began to make houses of
          leaves, others to hollow out caves under mountains, and some in the
          imitation of nests and constructions of swallows began to fashion from
          mud and twigs places where they could dwell.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This passage is famous for how Vitruvius tells of the origins of
          architecture in such a way that it “becomes embedded with the memory of
          primary human symbols, especially of fire and of the hearth, and of
          shelter.”<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">21</a></sup> As before, however, the focus of this current study is on
          the architect’s language. And it is notable that just as humans start
          building physical structures, they are also said to be “building”
          language (cf. <em>uocabula…constituerunt</em>) – and with it the very
          foundations of society.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">22</a></sup> It makes sense, then, that Vitruvius’
          language itself suggests a correlation between political associations
          and their architecture: without architecture, there would be no language
          and no civilization.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">23</a></sup> “In other matters, and especially in
          architecture,” Vitruvius claims, “there are these two components: that
          which is signified and that which signifies.”<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">24</a></sup> In Roman
          architecture, for Vitruvius, it is not just the state that is signified
          by architectural structures, but the idea of order itself – whether
          physical, political, or perhaps even linguistic.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Only a few paragraphs later in Book 2 of the <em>De architectura</em> the
          reader comes to a passage that confirms more concretely the deep
          connection between architecture and the Roman state in particular:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>apud ceteras quoque gentes et nonnulla loca pari simulique ratione
          casarum perficiuntur <strong>constitutiones</strong>. Non minus etiam Massiliae
          animaduertere possumus sine tegulis subacta cum paleis terra tecta.
          Athenis Areopagi antiquitatis exemplar ad hoc tempus luto tectum. Item
          in Capitolio commonefacere potest et significare <strong>mores</strong> uetustatis
          Romuli casa et in arce sacrorum stramentis tecta. (Vitr. 2.1.5)</p>
          
            <p>Among other peoples and in certain places, as well, the <strong>structures</strong>
          of houses are fashioned in a like and similar way. No less can we pass
          over the roofs at Marseilles which are made without tiles but with
          earth joined with straw. The Areopagus at Athens – still an example of
          antiquity – is roofed with clay. In the same way Romulus’ hut covered
          with straw on the Capitoline is able to call to mind and signify the
          <strong><em>mores</em></strong> of antiquity. The same can be said of the roofs of the
          temples on the citadel.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In the immediately preceding sentences Vitruvius is merely discussing
          how peoples in different places build their houses with the materials
          available to them. However, as the architect continues to list the
          varieties of materials necessary for the various kinds of
          <em>constitutiones</em>, his language starts to slip between describing the
          physical structures that remain and the <em>mores</em> (“behavior/customs”) of
          the people who built them. This transition starts perhaps with a mention
          of the Areopagus in Athens, which still exists as “an example of
          antiquity,” but becomes more pronounced in the discussion of Romulus’
          hut. “The image here is of a primitive hut,” of course, but as Idris
          McEwan rightly suggests in her reading of the passage, “primitive
          construction methods are not its signified matter.” It is such a basic
          assumption for Vitruvius that the <em>constitutiones</em> of old buildings
          represent the early “foundations” of the state – the <em>mores</em> upon which
          it stands, as Ennius and Cicero put it – that he easily transitions from
          talking about roof-making in Marseilles to the famous Areopagus of
          Athens to Romulus’ hut in Rome together with the <em>mores</em> that it
          represents.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This all appears to be very natural for Vitruvius, though. In his mind,
          at least, architecture and political structures (together with the
          language to describe them both) have been closely bound from the very
          start of human civilization. And it is by practicing architecture, he
          goes on to claim in the very next paragraph, that humankind not only
          discovered “other arts and disciplines,” but also advanced “from a wild
          and savage life to civilized society.”<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">27</a></sup> It is by <em>doing</em>
          architecture, in other words, that people began to understand and
          conceptualize other “structures” – scientific as well as political.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">28</a></sup>
          It is not hard in that case to see why architecture and architectural
          language are such important parts of how Vitruvius articulates what he
          sees happening to the landscape of Rome under Augustus both physically
          and metaphorically. In short, the idea of “structure” – be it political
          or otherwise – is by its very nature architectural for Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>If we return to Vitruvius’s preface it is perhaps possible to see more
          clearly now why he is so prone to employ architectural imagery to
          communicate the changes that Augustus made to the <em>res publica</em> through
          his public and private buildings. Since systems are inherently
          architectural for Vitruvius, it makes sense that the architect uses
          architectural imagery to convey the change in Rome’s system of
          government – that is, its structure, or in Latin, its <em>consitutio</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Did all Romans consciously see such a deep connection between
          architecture and the imaginative systems by which they ordered their
          existence? It is not possible to determine that with any certainty. And
          we should be cautious about applying the <em>specifics</em> of Vitruvius’ views
          as an architect to what other Romans, including Augustus, may have
          consciously thought about architecture’s power as a metaphor for the way
          they conceived the world around them. There is fortunately other
          evidence, however, that suggests how architecture may have been an
          essential component in the way that Romans gave order and meaning to
          their lives and thoughts. The famous “art of memory” (<em>ars memoriae</em>)
          that Roman orators employed required its users, as the next section will
          demonstrate, to create architectural settings in their minds for the
          purpose of structuring their own thoughts, as well as the thoughts of
          their audiences.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2-the-architecture-of-the-roman-ars-memoriae">Part 2. The Architecture of the Roman <em>Ars Memoriae</em></h3>
          
          <p>In Book 2 of the <em>De oratore</em> Cicero writes about how the Greek poet
          Simonides invented the so-called “art of memory.”<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">30</a></sup> And the
          particular origin story that Cicero describes is relevant to this
          current study for the role that architecture plays in it. The poet is
          said to have been dining with one of his patrons, Scopas, when he was
          called outside to meet with a pair of youths. As soon as he left,
          though, the room (<em>conclave</em>) in which they were dining collapsed upon
          Scopas and his companions. But when the friends of the dead wished to
          bury their comrades it was Simonides who was able to help identify each
          of the corpses because he knew the place in which each of them had sat
          by remembering the setting itself.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">31</a></sup> It was because of this, Cicero
          writes, that the poet “is reported to have discovered that it is order
          most of all that gives clarity to memory” (<em>invenisse fertur ordinem
          esse maxime, qui memoriae lumen adferret</em>, Cic. <em>De or.</em> 2.353).
          Simonides thus came to the conclusion that one could create places in
          the mind to set the ideas one wanted to remember. In this way, then,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>ut ordinem rerum locorum ordo conservaret, res autem ipsas rerum
          effigies notaret atque ut locis pro cera, simulacris pro litteris
          uteremur. (Cic. <em>De or</em>. 2.354)</p>
          
            <p>while the order of places would keep the order of things, the symbol
          of the things would denote the things themselves, and we would use the
          places as we would wax tablets, and the symbols as we would letters.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Given that the first place to be involved in the art of memory was a
          room in a house (<em>conclave</em>), it seems logical that it is mostly
          architectural locales which are recommended as the places in which to
          set symbols of what one wishes to remember. In the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
          Latin rhetorical treatise known as the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>, for
          instance, it is to architectural forms that the orator should turn as
          the most suitable places for grounding his memory:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Locos appellamus eos qui breviter, perfecte, insignite aut natura aut
          manu sunt absoluti, ut eos facile naturali memoria conprehendere et
          amplecti queamus: ut <strong>aedes, intercolumnium, angulum, fornicem, et
          alia quae his similia sunt</strong>. ([Cic.] <em>Rhet</em>. <em>Her</em>. 3.16.29)</p>
          
            <p>We call “settings” those places which are either naturally or
          artificially set off on a small scale, as a complete unit, and
          conspicuously, so that we can grasp and embrace them easily by our
          natural memory, such as <strong>a house, the space between two columns, a
          corner, an arch, and other settings like these.</strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Although the writer of the treatise suggests that the best places to set
          symbols can be either “naturally or artificially set off” as distinct
          (<em>aut natura aut manu…absoluti</em>), his list of locales includes <em>only</em>
          architectural ones.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Natural spaces can of course be small in scale
          (<em>breviter</em>) and quite conspicuous (<em>insignite</em>) – both of which are
          good qualities for constructing memory stores. It is architecture,
          though, that best provides the sense of completeness (cf. <em>perfecte</em>)
          which can give order and stability to a system of memory in which to
          place symbols.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Architectural settings give clear, distinct
          boundaries, in other words, which promote a sense of order that a fully
          natural setting on its own would seem less able to create.</p>
          
          <p>Nor does it matter in the end how conspicuous and memorable a symbol on
          it own might be. As the author of the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> stresses,
          it is absolutely essential for orators to keep the architectural
          backgrounds themselves fresh in their minds:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Sed <strong>illud facere oportebit</strong>, ut identidem primos quosque <strong>locos</strong>
          imaginum renovandarum causa celeriter animo pervagemus. ([Cic.]
          <em>Rhet</em>. <em>Her</em>. 3.22.37)</p>
          
            <p>But <strong>it will be essential to do this</strong>: that we again and again run
          quickly in our minds through all the original <strong>places</strong> for the sake
          of remembering the symbols.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Orators should think of symbols that are distinctive enough to keep
          separate in their minds; even more important, though, they must be able
          to refresh the backgrounds for these symbols, or else it would seem that
          the symbols have little value for memory on their own.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">34</a></sup> If you lose
          the place, in other words, you risk losing all the symbols that go with
          it, too.</p>
          
          <p>As scholars have argued, however, these “memory mansions” can affect not
          just the minds of the orators, but potentially the minds of their
          audiences, as well. In her influential book on Cicero’s use of space Ann
          Vasaly has shown the way in which the <em>ars memoriae</em> also impacted how
          the listeners of an oration would see the world around them. Since the
          “training in the <em>ars memoriae</em> not only accustomed the orator to create
          ‘visual’ pictures in his mind but taught him to associate abstract ideas
          with these pictures,”<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">35</a></sup> Vasaly suggests that</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Cicero may well have understood that the mnemonic technique by which
          he impressed ideas on his own mind could be employed to impress
          concepts on the minds of his listeners. […] Cicero’s connection of
          ideas with specific places and objects… might…have figured in his
          application (whether conscious or unconscious) of the principles of
          the <em>ars memoriae</em> to the task of manipulating the thoughts and
          feelings of an audience.”<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">36</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>It is in part this specific understanding of the <em>ars memoriae</em> that
          leads Vasaly to conclude her study with the pithy (and oft-cited) remark
          that Cicero’s “constant reliance on the visual and the concrete was but
          the Roman gateway to the world of ideas.”<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote">37</a></sup> Although only the Roman
          orator would see the memory mansion, of course, the construction of that
          structure might have demonstrated to him the usefulness of using “the
          concrete” (as Vasaly puts it) in order to impact the minds of his
          listeners, too. “This method of memory training reminds us,” as Bettina
          Bergmann claims, “how essential the built frame was for the Romans as an
          organizer of objects, thoughts, and experience.”<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It is therefore
          architecture, just as it was for Vitruvius above, which can be said to
          have provided a sense of order for the Romans – even for a world created
          within their imaginations.</p>
          
          <p>Now that the fundamental connections between architecture and structure
          in the constructions of the Roman state and of Roman memory have been
          outlined it is possible to discuss a particular kind of architectural
          space that links these two “structures” even more closely. These special
          spaces which will be examined throughout the rest of this dissertation
          produced a powerful and persuasive reminder of the past in the present
          by serving as both setting and symbol at the same time. They thus acted
          as an essential means by which Romans could establish an identity for
          themselves that transcended time and (re-)defined their past as part
          their present. These incredible and fascinating structures are what the
          Romans called <em>monumenta</em> (“monuments”).</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-3-roman-monumenta-and-monumentality">Part 3. Roman <em>Monumenta</em> and Monumentality</h3>
          
          <p>There is a clear divide in rhetorical theory between the architectural
          settings and the symbols one places within them. As noted in the
          previous section, Cicero writes that “while the order of places would
          keep the order of things, the symbol of the things would denote the
          things themselves.”<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote">39</a></sup> In the preface to Vitruvius’ treatise, however,
          Augustus’ architectural structures <em>themselves</em> seem to become the
          symbols for representing his power: they are to serve as the “memorials”
          (<em>memoriae</em>) to be handed down to posterity in proportion to the
          “height” (<em>amplitudo</em>) of the <em>princeps</em>’ achievements.<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Such
          buildings have a different effect on one’s memory than simply being the
          background in which symbolic objects are placed; rather, they are in a
          sense the symbols, too – just as both the Areopagus in Athens and
          Romulus’ hut on the Capitoline can come to symbolize ancient <em>mores</em> in
          Vitruvius’ eyes.<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote">41</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Architectural structures of this sort thus occupy a unique space as both
          the symbol and the setting, representing what must be remembered and the
          space that can give a solid form to that symbol in the imagination. The
          Romans had a particular word for such a structure: <em>monumentum</em>.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote">42</a></sup>
          For the Romans, at least, a <em>monumentum</em> provided not just a “reminder”
          of some event or person in the past; more than that, it presented a
          tangible, ordered, and often very conspicuous space in which to ground
          and sometimes redefine that memory.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote">43</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The next part of this chapter will demonstrate that the label of
          <em>monumentum</em> need not be applied to a literal building – let alone a
          physical object – in the text of Livy’ <em>Ab urbe condita</em>. That does not
          mean, however, that an architectural significance is ever completely
          absent from the term. In his <em>De latina lingua</em>, for instance, the
          1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE antiquarian Varro provides an etymology which stresses
          an evolution of the word along architectural lines.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Meminisse a memoria, cum in id quod remansit in mente rursus movetur;
          quae a manendo ut manimoria potest esse dicta. […] Ab eodem monere,
          quod is qui monet, proinde sit ac memoria; sic monimenta quae in
          <strong>sepulcris</strong>, et ideo secundum viam, quo praetereuntis admoneant et
          se fuisse et illos esse mortalis. Ab eo <strong>cetera quae scripta ac facta
          memoriae causa</strong> monimenta dicta. (Varro <em>Ling.</em> 6.49)<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote">44</a></sup></p>
          
            <p><em>Meminisse</em> (“to remember”) comes from <em>memoria</em> (“memory”), since
          there is again movement back toward that which has remained in the
          mind – and it is possible that this word was derived from <em>manere</em>
          (“to remain”) like <em>manimoria.</em> […] From the same word comes
          <em>monere</em> (“remind”), because he who reminds is exactly like a memory;
          so are derived <em>monimenta</em> (“monuments”) which are in <strong>gravesites</strong>,
          and for that reason they are along the road so that they can remind
          passersby that they themselves lived and that the passersby are
          mortal. From this definition <strong>other things that are written or
          produced for the sake of memory</strong> are called <em>monimenta</em>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Although the word <em>monumenta</em> was originally attached to “gravesites”
          (<em>sepulchra</em>) along the road, Varro claims that the word eventually came
          to refer to anything “written or produced for the sake of memory” (cf.
          <em>cetera quae scripta ac facta memoriae causa</em>).<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote">45</a></sup> This particular
          version of the word’s history does suggest, however, that Romans at the
          end of the republic still understood the architectural significance of
          <em>monumentum</em>; in fact, as John Bodel puts it, “[t]he term
          <em>monumentum</em>…was in classical Latin <em>vox propria</em> for ‘tomb’, and the
          primary purpose of a tomb.”<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote">46</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>A <em>monumentum</em> is thus on the one hand an object that reminds us of
          something else – something that is absent, that is abstract, that is
          separate from us.<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote">47</a></sup> Roman monumentality creates a kind of “aura,” as
          Walter Benjamin would say, that produces “a sense of distance, however
          close [an object] may be” (<em>apparition unique d’un lointain, si proche
          soit-il</em>).<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote">48</a></sup> And yet architectural <em>monumenta</em> are present, right in
          front of us, visible as well as tangible. It is just as important to
          acknowledge this sense of presence together with that of absence because
          of the effects that the former can have upon a viewer. For example, as
          Jaś Elsner claims in his study on the discourse of monumentality in
          Greco-Roman historiography,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>monuments as ideas or ideological constructs always have the added
          dimension of having been real things. They authorize discourse, and
          thus act to persuade the reader, by referring with apparent simplicity
          to artefacts outside language. […] They <em>exist</em> (as artefacts), and
          so what they <em>mean</em> (as signs in language) must therefore be
          true.<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote">49</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The “present-ness” of a monument makes it an effective form of
          persuasion. Architectural structures of stone or some other long-lasting
          material impose a sense of solidity and permanence upon the mind of an
          onlooker that helps turn such artifacts into “proof” that an event in
          the past happened.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote">50</a></sup> There is a reason, as discussed above in the
          preceding section, why Roman orators relied upon such structures not
          only for enhancing their own memories but even for changing the
          perspectives of their audiences. What could be a more persuasive form of
          evidence than an imposing structure that seems to resist the corrupting
          agents of time or the limits of gravity placed upon all things?</p>
          
          <p>Roman monumentality when understood in this light is not merely about
          the size or shape of a structure.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote">51</a></sup> Nor about the time and wealth
          that it took to construct it.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Nor even necessarily related to the
          monumental nature of the “subject” itself that is being
          commemorated.<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote">53</a></sup> All those aspects – together with the sense of
          durability discussed above – do contribute to monumentality. As I define
          it, however, monumentality is the ability of a structure in particular
          to suggest something significant about the past to a viewer, that is, to
          urge an onlooker to stop and reflect upon the structure’s meaning.<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote">54</a></sup>
          I am not suggesting that all “documents” of the past should necessarily
          be seen as monuments, as Michel Foucault claimed that they are today by
          historians.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote">55</a></sup> It is rather the sense of having an architectural
          <em>structure</em> – as with the original conception of the Roman <em>monumentum</em>
          as a tomb noted above – which sets monuments apart from other objects of
          the past in this dissertation. That structure does not always have to be
          literal, of course, as we will see in the case of the poetry examined in
          the following chapters. What all these texts do have in common is the
          way they use the idea of structure inherent to Roman monumentality to
          configure the generic boundaries of their poetry – whether by stressing
          it (Chapter III), destabilizing it (Chapter IV-V), or even transcending
          it (Chapter VI).</p>
          
          <p>The location, the size, the material, the decoration, the labor, even
          the age<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote">56</a></sup> – all these attributes, either in total or individually,
          open up a dialogue with the viewer.<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote">57</a></sup> Why is a monument where is?
          What does its form or decoration or inscription signify? Who built it
          and why? And ultimately what does it mean to me and who I am? Those are
          just a few of the questions that a monumental structure raises in the
          imagination of whoever its audience may be. There might not be one
          meaning, of course, but the point is that a structure with monumentality
          can stimulate people who come across it to respond by thinking about its
          significance to them and by extension their place in the world.</p>
          
          <p>It is this quality of monumentality to cause reflection that makes
          monuments so important for the way that many cultures give definition to
          their own identity. For the Romans, too, as Wallace-Hadrill suggests,
          “monumental building require[d] such a concerted attempt on the part
          of a community, [was] such a commitment of resource, and le[ft]
          behind so conspicuous a public symbol, that it is hard not to read it as
          a significant statement of identity.”<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote">58</a></sup> Part 1 of this chaptr
          suggested that such an understanding of monumentality underlies several
          of the passages from Vitruvius’ treatise: a <em>monumentum</em> such as the hut
          of Romulus can serve, for instance, as a mirror by which Romans could
          understand the humble <em>mores</em> of Rome’s past – just as the grand
          monuments of the architect’s present could help Romans come to terms
          with the current greatness of their empire, as well as that of their new
          <em>princeps</em>.</p>
          
          <p>There is another side to monumentality, however, that is just as
          important to consider when looking at the idea of the monument in the
          Roman imagination. In the moment that a <em>monumentum</em> causes its onlooker
          to think about its meaning there is also the opportunity for him or her
          in this instant of reflection to consider the nature of monuments
          themselves. There is an opening, in other words, to think about how a
          monument works – as well as how it might fail. In an illuminating essay
          on monuments in Roman poetry Don Fowler tried to articulate this complex
          duality which is inherent to monumentality:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>The epistemological status of the monument is an uncertain one…
          Reading the stones is always multiple, but it cannot be so controlled:
          and it will do no good to argue that those who read the monuments
          differently must have been misreading them. […] The essence of the
          monument is paradoxically its lack of monumental stability, the way in
          which it is constantly reused and given new meaning, and therefore its
          inability to offer a return rather than a new journey.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote">59</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Monuments do not last forever.<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote">60</a></sup> Yet their physical appearance is not
          the lone aspect of these structures that begins to fade away with time:
          their meaning is subject to change even more rapidly perhaps with each
          new viewer. Although modern scholarship tends to describe this
          epistemological “failure” of the monument as part of its so-called
          “death” in the 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries,<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote">61</a></sup>
          this dissertation suggests that the Romans of the Augustan age productively
          acknowledged and even embraced the inherent malleability of meaning
          within their idea of monumentality.<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote">62</a></sup> The chapters following this one
          will examine how the Augustan poets engaged with the monumentalization
          of Rome by staging it in the monumentalization of their own poems –
          taking advantage of the dual nature of monuments to open the process up
          to critique while contributing to it at the same time. In the concluding
          chapter I will return to the issues surrounding monumentality in our own
          present to suggest that the Romans responded to a monument’s dual nature
          as both stable and instable epistemologically not by proclaiming its
          “death,” as many have today, but rather by utilizing that very same
          (seemingly paradoxical) stable flexibility to breathe new life into
          traditional structures, generic and political as much as architectural.</p>
          
          <p>Before I begin to analyze Augustan poetry, however, it will be
          beneficial to have a better sense of the sort of monumental discourse
          with which the poets were engaging. And for that I will now turn to a
          prose author and text whose monumentality has been the focus of much
          scholarship: Livy and his history of Rome <em>Ab urbe condita</em> (“From the
          Founding of the City”).<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote">63</a></sup> My focus here will be on Livy’s famous
          preface. Not only will the analysis of Livy’s text provide a taste for
          what is to follow in the examination of Augustan poets; it will also
          illustrate in action several of the ideas regarding monumentality in the
          Roman imagination discussed thus far.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-4-livys-monumental-history">Part 4. Livy’s Monumental History</h3>
          
          <p>The Roman historian Livy started at the very beginning of the Augustan
          age to write his history on the city of Rome from its earliest days to
          his present. The preface to this immense work presents a connection
          between architecture and the state that is very similar in certain
          respects to the one that was analyzed above in the imagery of Vitruvius’
          treatise. There is a difference, though, and a rather important one:
          whereas the architect writes about the building up of Rome, the
          historian is focused just as much on Rome’s supposed “collapse.” Livy
          was writing at a time when Rome was in ruin – both the physical city and
          the idea of the state – and the future seemed far from certain.<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote">64</a></sup>
          What matters most for the present study is that Livy seems to put forth
          his own work as a possible solution to the breakdown of Rome’s
          “structure.” He fashions his history as a <em>monumentum</em> in itself – one
          that can anchor and materialize the past while at the same time
          utilizing the less stable side of monumentality to fashion better
          readers of Rome’s monumentalization under Augustus.</p>
          
          <p>Several passages in Livy’s preface aim to establish his history as
          another <em>monumentum</em> within the city of Rome. The historian quite
          explicitly uses the example of a monument, in fact, in explaining to his
          readers how they should understand his work:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum,
          omnis te exempli <strong>documenta</strong> in inlustri posita <strong>monumento</strong>
          <strong>intueri</strong>; inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capias, inde
          foedum inceptu foedum exitu quod uites. (Liv. Pr.10)<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote">65</a></sup></p>
          
            <p>There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful part in the study
          of [past] affairs, namely, that you <strong>examine proofs</strong> of every
          possible example as set on a distinguished <strong><em>monumentum</em></strong>. You may
          then choose for yourself and your state what to imitate, as well as
          what you should avoid as bad in their beginning as they are in their
          outcome.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In this way, as scholars have argued, Livy’s history itself also becomes
          a kind of <em>monumentum</em>.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote">66</a></sup> The language he uses here transforms his
          readers into viewers who can examine (<em>intueri</em>) the examples
          (<em>exempla</em>) that Livy puts forth in his text – choosing to emulate the
          good and avoid the bad. This is not the first time in the preface that
          Livy uses the word <em>monumentum</em>, either. A few sentences earlier he
          mentions that he is not going to affirm or deny the tales of Rome’s
          early history which he claims are “more fitting for poetic stories than
          for the incorruptible <em>monumenta</em> of accomplishments” (<em>poeticis magis
          decora fabulis quam incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis</em>, Pr. 6). It
          is clear here, too, that Livy sees his work as on par with <em>monumenta</em>.
          It is important to note, moreover, that for Livy these “monuments” take
          on the quality of being able to display an established truth as opposed
          to poems which are filled with mere “stories” (<em>fabulae</em>). It would
          seem, in other words, that the historian fashions his history as a
          <em>monumentum</em> at least in part because of the ability that monuments have
          to serve as more fitting sources of “proof” than mere words themselves.
          As discussed in the previous section, architectural <em>monumenta</em> do at
          least appear to have a certain stability – physical and therefore
          epistemological – which can lend credence to the events of the past that
          they commemorate. And it is precisely because of their status as
          (seemingly) stable evidence that Livy claims they can present actual
          <em>exempla</em> from the past to imitate or avoid.</p>
          
          <p>Livy’s use of architectural imagery is much more nuanced, however, and
          it will be necessary to examine the architectural nature of a few other
          passages from the preface to grasp more accurately what he sees as the
          purpose of his work.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote">67</a></sup> Just a couple of sentences earlier, for
          instance, Livy talks of his work in the context of other writers who
          have done or will do more than he has – and thus cast him and his work
          into obscurity:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…si in tanta scriptorum turba mea fama <strong>in obscuro</strong> sit, nobilitate
          ac <strong>magnitudine</strong> eorum me qui nomini officient meo consoler. (Liv.
          Pr.3)</p>
          
            <p>…if in such a great crowd of writers my own reputation should be
          thrown <strong>into the shade</strong>, I would console myself with the renown and
          <strong>greatness</strong> of those who obscure my fame.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Here the architectural metaphor applies to more than just Livy’s work:
          other historians have in a sense “erected” histories whose great size
          will throw his history into their shade. They not only have a certain
          nobility (<em>nobilitas</em>) because of their undertakings, but their works
          also have a certain magnitude (<em>magnitudo</em>). Given the way that Livy
          carefully configures his work as a <em>monumentum</em> it seems likely here
          that he means something more than huge volumes that exceed his in
          physical size. Each history is seen by Livy as a “monument” in its own
          right – perhaps just like the ones that had begun to fill Rome as the
          <em>princeps</em> started to assert his power and transform the architectural
          landscape of the city in the early 20s BCE.</p>
          
          <p>There is even more to examine here, though. Livy’s metaphorical use of
          <em>magnitudo</em> in this passage is not far from the way examined earlier
          that Vitruvius employed <em>amplitudo</em> in relation to the transformation of
          the Roman state under Augustus.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote">68</a></sup> And Livy not surprisingly justifies
          his own work – which is by no means small – by juxtaposing it to the
          “size” of the Roman state, too:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Res est praeterea et immensi operis, ut quae supra septingentesimum
          annum repetatur et quae ab exiguis profecta initiis eo creuerit ut iam
          <strong>magnitudine</strong> laboret sua. (Liv. Pr.4)</p>
          
            <p>The subject, moreover, is also one of an immense labor, as one which
          we must investigate starting from over 700 years ago and which, having
          originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
          now toils under its own <strong>great size</strong>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Even if the Roman historian’s <em>monumentum</em> is not the largest, it is by
          no means small, either. Livy’s topic necessitates a certain “size,” as
          he immediately goes on to say, because the subject – that is, the
          history of Rome – requires an immense amount of work (cf. <em>res est
          praeterea et immensi operis</em>). Livy’s monument must be large enough, in
          other words, to cover the whole history of Rome – a place which, having
          “originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
          toils under its own great size” (<em>ab exiguis profecta initiis eo
          creverit ut iam magnitudine laboret sua</em>).</p>
          
          <p>The architectural imagery in the preface thus extends to more than
          simply Livy’s own history, or even those of his peers; it also extends
          to the greatness of Rome itself. Livy is thus clearly participating in
          the same tradition of looking at the Roman state architecturally that
          was examined above in the works of Ennius, Cicero, and, most notably,
          Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote">69</a></sup> It is important to note, however, that unlike Vitruvius
          the historian here speaks of a state – and the <em>mores</em> upon which it was
          founded – not increasing in magnificence but instead in terms that
          suggests its gradual “collapse,”<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote">70</a></sup> as the following passage
          demonstrates:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>labente</strong> deinde paulatim <strong>disciplina</strong> uelut <strong>dissidentes</strong><sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote">71</a></sup>
          primo mores sequatur animo, deinde ut magis magisque <strong>lapsi sint</strong>,
          tum <strong>ire</strong> coeperint <strong>praecipites</strong>… (Liv. Pr.9)</p>
          
            <p>Then as gradually morality <strong>declines</strong>, let [the reader] follow how
          our <em>mores</em> at first <strong>fractured</strong>, then <strong>collapsed</strong> more and more,
          and finally began <strong>to plunge into headlong ruin</strong>…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The very same <em>mores</em> that were the foundations upon which we saw Ennius
          and Cicero claim the Roman state stood (<em>moribus antiquis res stat
          romana virisque</em>) have gradually weakened over the course of Rome’s
          history until the point that they have now “collapsed” (<em>lapsi</em>) – and
          sent the state into ruin with them (<em>ire</em>…<em>praecipites</em>).<sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote">72</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>In the above analysis of Vitruvius’ treatise it was argued that to view
          the state architecturally also meant that its physical architecture
          would become symbolic for the idea of the <em>res publica</em> itself. This is
          significant for the present discussion of Livy because the physical
          setting of Rome had deteriorated much in the 1st century BCE, at least
          from the perspective of texts of the period which connect this apparent
          physical deterioration to that of state’s metaphorical structure and
          <em>mores</em>. For example, Horace emphatically begins one of his famous
          “Roman <em>Odes</em>” with a lament for “the collapsing (<em>labentis</em>) temples of
          the gods” – together with an exhortation to Romans to “restore”
          (<em>reficere</em>) them if they are ever to atone for the sins of their
          fathers committed during the civil wars:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Delicta maiorum inmeritus lues,

          <strong>aedisque abentis</strong> deorum et

            <p>Though you do not deserve it, Roman, you will continue to atone for
          your fathers’ sins, until you have <strong>restored the temples and the
          collapsing shrines</strong> of all the gods and their images defiled with
          black smoke.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>For the poet the physical renewal of Rome is absolutely essential to its
          metaphorical reconstruction: the Romans cannot make up for the damage
          they did to the state in the past until they rebuild the temples that
          represented their former virtues. The <em>monumenta</em> in Rome had begun to
          crack, in other words, and so had its people’s belief in the virtue that
          these structures were supposed to represent.<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote">73</a></sup> For Rome to
          re-establish itself and breathe life back into the values it had relied
          upon during its rise to power not only did someone have to improve the
          physical landscape of the city – or restore (<em>reficere</em>) it, as Horace
          writes – but that person also had to re-establish the belief in that
          landscape’s ability to reflect what it meant to be Roman as it had done
          in the past.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote">74</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>If that is the case, though, an interesting question arises: how should
          one read Livy’s <em>monumentum</em> in the context of such “ruin”? What purpose
          does it have when it would seem that the “structures” of Rome’s past
          have themselves collapsed? It has been suggested that Livy’s
          <em>monumentum</em> represents a small part of a rehabilitation process – not
          just as another monument to Rome, but also as a means of revitalizing
          the Roman people’s belief in the structures that these monuments were
          meant to symbolize.<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote">75</a></sup> As Mary Jaeger has shown in her monograph on
          the topic, however, the process by which Livy accomplishes this task is
          not a simple one. Jaeger argues that the historian’s focus on monuments
          both provides lessons about the past and at the same time should make a
          reader suspicious of those same lessons. Since Livy must rely on
          imperfect monuments of the past to construct his history, his work
          simultaneously cannot but “remind the reader that a coherent account of
          real past events is not a reproduction but a reconstruction.”<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote">76</a></sup>
          Jaeger looks particularly at <em>monumenta</em> in the text that “fail to point
          unambiguously back to a particular person or event” in order to show how
          Livy provides an alternative perspective to Augustus’ “Golden Age”
          Rome.<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote">77</a></sup> This is not so much to critique the <em>princeps</em>’
          monumentalization of the city as to “construct a reader” who could play
          in active role in interpreting monuments and thus make “national memory
          personal.” The historian accomplished this task, according to Jaeger, by
          making sure that his readers would “receiv[e] Livy’s interpretation of
          the past, not just as images in the mind’s eye, but as a heightened and
          altered awareness of the space around him or her.”<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote">78</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It was not Livy’s responsibility alone to “construct” readers who could
          critically read Augustus’ monumentalization of Rome and understand their
          place in it. Subsequent chapters of this dissertation will show how the
          historian was indeed not the only writer in the Augustan age to critique
          the project of monumentalization to which he was also contributing
          through his monumental work. The critical assessment of Rome’s
          transformation that I argue can be found in several poets of the
          Augustan age may have been just as important part of its eventual
          success as the historian’s contribution.</p>
          
          <p>Before I turn to how these poets contributed to this project, though, it
          is time to return to where this chapter began, namely, with Augustus and
          his <em>Res Gestae</em>. Although I will come back to the <em>princeps</em>’ version
          of his transformation of Rome in much more detail at the end of each
          subsequent chapter (with the exception of Chapter IV), the present
          analysis of Augustus’ language here in the final section of this chapter
          will help to demonstrate how the <em>princeps</em> dealt with the
          reconstruction of the state’s appearance not just in reality, but in the
          Roman imagination, as well, from the very start of his account.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-5-a-monument-to-the-monumentalization-of-rome">Part 5. A Monument to the Monumentalization of Rome</h3>
          
          <p>In the opening chapter of his <em>Res Gestae</em> Augustus speaks of the two
          charges that he received when he first came into real power:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>res publica</strong> <strong>n[e quid detrimenti caperet,]</strong> me pro praetore
          simul cum consulibus pro[videre iussit. p]opulus autem eodem anno me
          consulem, cum [consul uterqu]e in bel[lo ceci]desset, et
          <strong>triumvirum rei publicae constituend[ae</strong> creavit]. (<em>RGDA</em> 1.3-4)</p>
          
            <p>The state ordered me as a propraetor to take care together with the
          consuls <strong>that it not be diminished in any way</strong>. In the same year,
          moreover, the people elected me as consul, when both consuls had died
          in war, and as triumvir <strong><em>rei publicae constituendae</em></strong>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>As a <em>propraetor</em> the young Octavian was assigned by the state itself to
          take care “lest it be diminished in any way” (<em>ne quid detrimenti
          caperet</em>). In the same year, moreover, the people elected him as consul
          and triumvir <em>rei publicae constituendae</em>. The wording of these two
          charges is not entirely unexpected or remarkable. The first was the
          “usual formula” for addressing emergencies in the late republic when a
          <em>senatus consultum ultimum</em> (SCU) was issued.<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote">79</a></sup> And <em>rei publicae
          constituendae</em> is a stock phrase of sorts – one that might have
          originated with Sulla,<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote">80</a></sup> one which was used often by Cicero in his
          works,<sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote">81</a></sup> and one that can be found on several denarii minted by the
          individuals of second triumvirate themselves.<sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote">82</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>These two tasks are thus not altogether novel – and Augustus certainly
          did not invent the language for them. But they do reflect something
          important about the Roman state suggested at length in this chapter,
          that is, the connection between architecture and the idea of the Roman
          state in the language that Romans used to discuss their <em>res publica</em>.
          There is the sense here, in other words, of there being a “structure” of
          the <em>res publica</em> in the words that Augustus uses to talk about his
          charges. For one, the word <em>detrimentum</em>, whose primary definition is
          “material reduction” or “diminishment,”<sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote">83</a></sup> is derived from <em>detero</em> –
          a verb that is specifically related to the wearing down of physical
          objects, such as streets (in Lucretius) or tablets (in
          Propertius).<sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote">84</a></sup> Moreover, although most translations of <em>rei publicae
          constituendae</em> read something like “for settling the state,” or “for
          setting the state to rights” (as one scholar translates it in a recent
          book which addresses the topic),<sup id="fnref:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote">85</a></sup> the verb <em>constituo</em> and its noun
          <em>constitutio</em><sup id="fnref:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote">86</a></sup> are commonly used to refer both to the “founding” of
          a city and its laws,<sup id="fnref:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote">87</a></sup> as well as to the “construction” of a
          building such as a house, as seen above in the passages from
          Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote">88</a></sup> Even at this early point in the <em>Res Gestae</em>, then, a
          reader would come across a subtle balancing act that the <em>princeps</em>
          performs again and again throughout the document: while Augustus was in
          charge of making sure that the “collapse” which Livy writes about did
          not continue, he simultaneously had to construct the Roman state anew.
          In other words, whereas Augustus needed to build a new Rome out of the
          ruin (<em>rei publicae constituendae</em>), he also needed to avoid damaging
          the traditional structure itself in any obvious way.</p>
          
          <p>Are these empty metaphors typical of an Augustan inscription? That
          possibility cannot entirely be ruled out, of course. What I would like
          to propose, however, is that the wording here and elsewhere in the <em>Res
          Gestae</em> suggests something essential about how Augustus articulated for
          posterity his (re-)construction of Rome upon its traditional
          foundations. It does not seem unreasonable, for instance, to connect the
          architectural discourse in the <em>RGDA</em> to the complex idea of the
          monument that underlies Augustus’ famous quote to have left Rome a city
          of marble examined in Chapter I.<sup id="fnref:118"><a href="#fn:118" class="footnote">89</a></sup> It is in fact the goal of each of
          the following the chapters to flesh out the nuances of this connection
          by juxtaposing later sections of the <em>Res Gestae</em> with close analysis of
          the <em>monumenta</em> that poets of the Augustan age built through their
          poems.</p>
          
          <p>It is certainly correct to say that “Augustus used the physical
          topography of the city to his advantage: through the reorganization of
          the urban environment of Rome, he effectively communicated that a change
          had taken place.”<sup id="fnref:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote">90</a></sup> And the way that the Augustan poets treated that
          topography in their poetry allowed Romans more fully to appreciate and
          better interpret the specific monuments of their physical reality. The
          point of this dissertation is to show how Horace, Vergil, and Ovid also
          helped their readers to navigate the architectural <em>discourse</em> that
          Augustus would use in his <em>Res Gestae</em> to articulate this
          monumentalization of their city. These three poets each provides a
          mirror, I will argue, by which we can understand how Augustus used
          architectural discourse to redefine, without appearing to knock down,
          the traditional boundaries that had “structured” the Roman state up to
          his time. By analyzing how they expand, test, and dissolve the generic
          boundaries of their poems <em>qua</em> “monuments” we can come to recognize the
          effectiveness of the <em>Res Gestae</em> to celebrate the monumentalization of
          Rome in reality as well as the idea of it in the Roman imagination. The
          rest of this dissertation will propose, in short, that the Augustan
          poets helped to fashion readers who could better understand what had
          happened to their Rome, real and imagined, through the lens of
          architectural discourse that their poetry helped to sharpen.</p>

                <p>Although Gordon 1968, 132, maintains that the <em>Res Gestae</em> is
          “simple in structure, flat, without style…not in the least
          reflective or philosophical in tone,” he nevertheless does provide a
          useful summary of what other critics have thought about the style of
          the <em>Res Gestae</em> – most of whom praise the inscription’s “clarity,”
          “brevity,” “simplicity,” and “cool dignity” (137-138, n. 61). Rowe
          2014 makes the intriguing suggestion that we should understand the
          <em>RGDA</em> as a compilation of various honorary decrees from the senate
          to Augustus that he (or someone else) put together just before his
          death in 14 CE; according to Rowe, in fact, the text is as much a
          “commemoration of commemorations” from the senate to Augustus as any
          personal statement by the <em>princeps</em> himself. <a href="#fnref:31" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>See Elsner 1996, 48, claiming that “[m]onumentality, the
          conceptual and rhetorical space a monument occupies in the
          environment of its observers, is of the essence to the <em>Res
          Gestae</em>’s programme.” Recent scholarship has paid particular
          attention to monumentality in the ancient world – from Häusle 1980,
          29-63, which examines the language of Roman monuments, to Elsner
          1994, analyzing the language describing monuments, to Fowler 2000,
          193-219, which looks critically at both these sets of discourse.
          Wiseman 1987, Bodel 1997, Eck 1997, and Roller 2010 all treat the
          monumentality of the physical aristocratic houses and villas in the
          late republic and early principate. Thomas and Meyers 2012
          represents perhaps the most recent attempt to define Roman
          monumentality, with particular emphasis on Etruscan and early Roman
          architecture. See Part 3 of the current chapter (pp. 29-36) for a
          fuller discussion of Roman monumentality, including the definition

          framed the viewing of Augustan Rome. For it told Romans how their

          however, the <em>Res Gestae</em> has the same effect for the <em>metaphorical</em>

          recent years. See Zanker 1988 for an approach to Augustan
          architecture that focuses on the architectural remains that have
          survived either physically or through the images from coins,
          painting, and literature. Ward-Perkins 1981 [1994], 21-45, and
          Favro 1998 present excellent overviews of Augustan architecture’s
          importance from this perspective, as well – the latter suggesting
          that “Augustus sparked a reconceptualization of the city’s physical
          form as a bearer of meaning” (216). But see also Galinsky 1996 and
          Wallace-Hadrill 2008 for analyses of Augustan culture that

          That is not an unreasonable suggestion. In this chapter, though, I

          fall, it has seemed appropriate to ransack preceding generations for
          symptoms of decline and signposts for the future. The portrait is
          shaped to suit the result – a retrojected prophecy.” However, as
          Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 56, argue, “[p]olitically, a ruinous

          fashioning, and…the notion that destruction and devastation are
          the foundations upon which the city flourishes is a vital
          element…of Augustus’ ‘cultural revolution.’” This dissertation is
          not concerned with the reality of a historical “collapse” of the
          republic, but rather examines that same “hindsight” which Gruen
          mentions – which clearly paints the narrative of Rome’s recent past
          as one of “collapse” – as found for instance in the works of Livy

          unity, and therefore forms an essential basis for its self-image and
          identity.” By turning Rome itself into a kind of <em>monumentum</em> – that
          is, by not simply adding monuments to its landscape, but
          transforming the landscape itself in the imagination of his subjects
          – Augustus could have a tremendous influence on the institutions and
          places through which the Roman people came to “articulate an

                <p>In examining the way that the poems of Vergil, Tibullus, and
          Propertius treat specific Augustan monuments, Rea 2007, 16, proposes
          that “the poets’ texts and the Augustan landscape, while raising
          awareness of both the potential advantages and problems that the
          community would encounter when trying to rebuild their society, also
          permitted viewers to realize their own conclusions about what they
          saw and took away from their interaction with the texts and the
          landscape.” Whereas Rea sees Augustus’ monuments as “inspiration”
          for the poets, it is important to consider their poems not merely as
          responses to the Augustan project of monumentalization, but as
          contributions to its definition, as well. <a href="#fnref:40" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          would appear in agreement with Vitruvius concerning the connection
          of human thought and architecture, as the nineteenth-century
          Frenchman would write that “[a]rchitecture…developed together
          with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a

          nothing becomes legible unless it is submitted to the architectural

          approach to this topic and argues that “[a]rchitecture is a
          materialization of structure, and the adoption of architecture as a

          society is founded on and dominated by the elementary and original

          refinement.’” In speaking of the emergence of Western politics in
          the Greco-Roman world, McEwan 1993, 73-74, goes so far as to suggest
          that “if we understand the craftsman as a <em>demiourgos</em> in the wider
          Greek sense of the term, yet retain the primordiality of the notion
          of craft in its more limited, physical sense, as the early Greeks
          did when they claimed that there was no community, no civilization,
          without such craft, then it becomes quite clear that the emergence
          of Greek politics – indeed of Western politics – hinged upon the
          craft tradition, and upon how craft was understood”; in fact,
          according to McEwan, “all of Western thinking was first grounded in
          architecture” (130). See also Senseney 2011, 9, where he argues for
          a connection between architectural drawing and the birth of Western
          philosophy. One of Senseney’s primary contentions is that we should
          understand the “relationship between drawing, seeing, and the birth

          permanence,” even if that anchoring itself is only temporary. There
          are other effects, of course, that a monument’s assumed stability
          and permanence can have upon its viewer according to modern
          scholarship on the topic. Choay 2001, 6-7, argues that “[f]or
          those who erect it, as for those who receive its messages, the
          monument is a defense against the traumas of existence, a security

          dissolving action of time on all things natural and artificial, it
          seeks to appease our fear of death and annihilation.” To this end,
          moreover, a monument can even serve as a means of proclaiming one’s
          immortality to posterity, as Wilson 1988, 130, suggests:
          “[Monuments] aim to produce <em>the effect of permanence.</em> At the

                <p>The 20<sup>th</sup>-century Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein would

          engenders a response in its viewer. “Architecture is a <em>gesture</em>,”

          body is a gesture. No more is every functional building

          where he argues that a “monument, the product of a people, can serve
          to epitomise what is typical about them. It can freeze what is…the
          essence of a people in a convenient and accessible miniature. The
          monument becomes not only the product of, but also a metonym for the
          race, the culture, the way of living, the rationality and
          expectations of the people and environment. […] They encapsulate
          identity by embodying the past as it exists in the present; they
          focus in terms of the past the present’s sense of being what it is.”
          On the connection between architecture and identity more broadly see
          also Norberg-Schulz 1971, 29, claiming that “[d]uring his [or
          her] development the individual discovers a structured whole which
          he [or she] shares with others and which more than anything else
          gives him [or her] a sense of identity,” and Sherratt 1990, 165,
          where the scholar concludes that “[m]egalith building became the
          metaphor within which social conflicts and ideological competition
          were played out. In this sense, megaliths were as much a cause as a

                <p>Many scholars of monumentality today have discounted the Roman
          version of the concept as facile. See Choay 2001, 19, arguing in her
          landmark study on the idea of the monument in Western culture that
          the monuments of the Romans – while seemingly based on a modern
          conception of monumentality – were “not oriented toward a vision of
          the past” in the way that modern ones are; rather, according to
          Choay, these monumental structures were “motivated by taste and a
          desire [on the part of the Romans] to infuse themselves visually
          with the plastic world of Greece.” See also Riegl 1903, 10, claiming
          that “[a]ll of Antiquity and the Middle Ages in essence only knew
          intentional monuments” (<em>Das ganze Altertum und Mittelalter haben
          nun im Grunde bloß gewollte Denkmale gekannt</em>). In the same essay,
          though, Riegl would at least admit that the Romans presented “an
          anachronistic precursor of modern commemorative value” (<em>ein
          anachronistischer Vorläufer des modernen Erinnerungswertes</em>). As I
          demonstrate in this dissertation, however, the Roman understanding
          of <em>monumenta</em> was highly-developed and perhaps even more nuanced in
          certain respects than the way many look at monuments today. <a href="#fnref:91" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>In writing of cultural memory in the Middle Republic, Hölkeskamp
          2006, 481, argues that “[t]he spectrum of forms, institutions, and
          places through which a cultural memory may find its articulation and
          permanence, the relative importance of these forms and, above all,
          the specific, synergetic connections of media and location that
          result in ‘systems’ or ‘landscapes’ of memory…are themselves
          integral components of [a society’s] cultural memory.” In the case
          of late republican Rome, however, there seems to have been the sense
          that this link between the “landscapes” of their city and the Roman
          “cultural memory” had been destabilized by the “collapse” of the
          structures themselves. <a href="#fnref:103" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>See Moles 1993, 153-154, arguing that “[i]n so far as it is an
          abiding monument, its solidity will help shore up the collapsing
          edifice of the Roman state… In important senses, therefore, it may
          be said that for Livy AUC history is his own work, the <em>Ab urbe
          condita</em>, and that in reconstructing Roman history he is in a moral
          sense reconstructing contemporary Rome.” See also Wheeldon 1989, 59,
          who concludes that “[h]ere, in addition to the traditional claim
          for the value of <em>historiae</em> as sources of right conduct, Livy
          offers first, in the image of monumentality, a summation of the
          earlier claims for his work (on the basis of its size and the labor
          involved in writing it) and second, in the order in which the
          metaphors of the two passages appear, the more ambitious suggestion
          of the reconstruction – via the reading of his own work – of Roman
          greatness.” It is not just Rome that he is reconstructing, I would
          argue, so much as the power of Roman monumentality itself to give
          Romans a sense of themselves as Romans in a new age. <a href="#fnref:104" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          “anachronistically introduces a phrase that gained constitutional
          significance only in his own lifetime.” It is interesting to note –
          as Hurlet 1993, 95, n.6 does – that this “expression is not attested

          applies to constitutions and real states. <em>Rem publicam constituere</em>
