        <h2 class='page-subtitle'>The “Failure” of <em>Monumenta</em> in the <em>Aeneid</em></h2>
      </header>
      <article class='page'>
        <main class='page-content'>
          <p>The previous chapter examined several examples of “failed” architecture
          in the <em>Aeneid</em>. These included in particular the constructed caves and
          the artful labyrinths meant to cover over and contain chaotic forces and
          elements of the past that would upset any established order imposed upon
          them. It is now time to see what this analysis brings to bear on how one
          might understand the <em>monumenta</em> in the poem and ultimately the
          monumental architexture of epic itself.</p>
          
          <p>Part 1 of this chapter will analyze three of the poem’s <em>monumenta</em>,
          namely, those on Crete that Anchises mentions in Book 3, those embodied
          by the Minotaur in Book 6, and those at the site of Rome that Evander
          shows to Aeneas in Book 8. By putting these <em>monumenta</em> within the
          context of the other architectural structures of the poem discussed in
          Chapter IV it becomes possible to see that they too are often
          unsuccessful in achieving a stable meaning, revealing the “cracks” in
          their epistemological foundations.<sup id="fnref:336"><a href="#fn:336" class="footnote">1</a></sup> These “failed” monuments should
          alert the reader to the instability of meaning inherent to monuments
          that has the potential to upset any stable narrative of the past (and
          future) that the monuments of the Augustan age – whether Augustus’ or
          that of the <em>Aeneid</em> itself – might try to establish.</p>
          
          <p>Part 2 will then build upon the conclusions reached regarding
          architectural boundaries and monuments in the poem in order to arrive at
          a definition of Vergil’s own architexture. Whereas Horace sought to
          stabilize the borders of his genre while subtly introducing extrageneric
          and novel material, Vergil’s poem shows us in contrast how the external
          facade of epic that he places upon his story of Rome is unstable: his
          epic frame cannot ultimately keep the chaotic forces of the Roman past
          from breaking through and disrupting a tidy teleological narrative from
          Aeneas to Augustus. An analysis of the <em>monumenta</em> on the Baldric of
          Pallas – read often as a <em>mise-en</em>-<em>abyme</em> for the poem itself – will
          serve to weave together the threads of thought from the preceding
          section and allow us to arrive at some general conclusions regarding the
          poem’s overall architextural structure. Like the frame of the baldric, I
          propose, the poem as a monument of Roman history fails to contain the
          chaos (actual and epistemological) that is a significant component of
          Rome’s story as Vergil tells it – a failure that is most apparent when
          Aeneas slaughters the injured and defenseless Turnus after seeing the
          baldric. It might then appear based on this reading that the <em>Aeneid</em>
          itself is just as much a “failed” <em>monumentum</em> as the ones that it
          contains.</p>
          
          <p>Yet, as I argue in Part 3, it is the very “failure” of the <em>Aeneid</em> as a
          monument that perhaps makes it a monumental success in the way in which
          the poem causes its readers to reflect upon the nature of monuments.
          What the <em>Aeneid</em> suggests is not that the instability of meaning makes
          all <em>monumenta</em> failures, <em>per se</em>, but that to appreciate a monument
          fully and learn all it has to tell us about the past we need be aware of
          the multiplicity of meanings that lie underneath what appears on its
          magnificent exterior. It is in this way, in fact, that I argue the poem
          can illustrate for its readers that the very power of a monument
          actually lies not only in its apparent stability (literal and
          epistemological) that Horace stressed, but also in the awareness on the
          part of the spectator of the monument’s capacity to fail – without which
          the “immortality” that a monument promises would have little meaning. As
          I suggest in concluding, moreover, this same polysemy of monuments did
          not escape Augustus, either, in his use of monuments in the <em>Res Gestae</em>
          to remember Rome’s own chaotic past – good and bad – while
          simultaneously giving his subjects hope for a better present and future.
          The nuanced way that the <em>princeps</em> describes the Temple of Janus in
          particular provides an interesting parallel to the sophisticated
          architextural <em>monumentum</em> that the <em>Aeneid</em> represents.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-1-vergilian-monumenta">Part 1. Vergilian <em>Monumenta</em></h3>
          
          <p>The previous chapter briefly mentioned the <em>monumenta</em> that Evander
          shows to Aeneas in Book 8. These are the only <em>monumenta</em> in the poem
          that are strictly architectural. At the same time, though, the poem is
          filled with several non-architectural <em>monumenta</em> that require attention
          for understanding what kind of monument the epic poem itself can be said
          to represent.<sup id="fnref:337"><a href="#fn:337" class="footnote">2</a></sup> This part of the present chapter will analyze a few
          of the most important <em>monumenta</em> in the poem before turning at last to
          the structures found at the proto-Rome of Evander. This brief survey
          will demonstrate not only that these monuments “fail” to maintain a
          stable meaning; it will also show, more importantly, that this
          instability of meaning leads to the kind of chaos and <em>errores</em> of the
          past that the failed structures examined in Chapter IV also could not
          contain.</p>
          
          <p>The very first time that word <em>monumentum</em> appears in the poem should
          not inspire confidence in the reader for the ability of “monuments” to
          present a stable and unambiguous meaning. When the Trojans are trying to
          decode Apollo’s prophecy that they should “seek their ancient mother”
          (<em>antiquam exquirite matrem</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 3.96), Anchises calls upon
          <em>monumenta</em> in order to find a solution to the puzzle:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>tum genitor ueterum uoluens monumenta uirorum
          “audite, o proceres,” ait “et spes discite uestras.
          Creta Iouis magni medio iacet insula ponto,
          mons ldaeus ubi et gentis cunabula nostrae. (<em>Aen</em>. 3.102-1065</p>
          
            <p>“Hear me, leaders,” said my father, revolving in his mind the
          <em>monumenta</em> of ancient men, “and learn what you can hope for. Crete
          lies in the middle of the sea, the island of mighty Jove, where there
          exists a Mt. Ida and the cradle of our race.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Aeneas’ father advises the Trojans to go to Crete where they can find
          their origins, that is, their <em>cunabula</em> (“cradle,” 105). This is the
          place, Anchises continues, where Cybele’s cult originated with its
          brazen symbols (cf. 3.111). The founder of Troy himself first came from
          this island, too – if Anchises remembers correctly (<em>si rite audita
          recordor</em>, 107) – and “therefore” (<em>ergo</em>, 114) it must be where the
          Trojans should found their city. This is not the right interpretation of
          Apollo’s prophecy, of course. What one should note here is the fact that
          it is specifically <em>monumenta</em> that cause Anchises to make such a
          mistake. They lead him and his fellow Trojans, in other words, to
          continue the <em>errores</em> that they have endured to that point since
          departing from the shores of Troy.</p>
          
          <p>The very first set of <em>monumenta</em> in the poem is thus a “failure.”
          Anchises’ mistake illustrates for the reader not just that monuments
          fail to provide their interpreters with a clear message; more than that,
          the failure here demonstrates that these structures can mislead their
          interpreters, too, as happens with the Trojans when they try impose
          their own meanings and desires upon them. The passage suggests, in other
          words, that the failure of a monument to achieve a single, stable
          meaning allows for the weary Trojans to fit these monuments – regardless
          of their original meaning – into an interpretation that on the one hand
          suits their desire for a new home, but on the other is still geared to
          their past and thus leads them away from arriving at their new
          future.<sup id="fnref:338"><a href="#fn:338" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>An even more complicated “monument” is the one which the labyrinth on
          Daedalus’ Doors both hides and makes its viewers remember, namely, the
          Minotaur represented in the carvings and labeled as the <em>Veneris
          monumenta nefandae</em> (<em>Aen</em>. 6.21),<sup id="fnref:339"><a href="#fn:339" class="footnote">4</a></sup> as discussed in the previous
          chapter.<sup id="fnref:340"><a href="#fn:340" class="footnote">5</a></sup> These <em>monumenta</em> are of particular importance since they
          present in an explicit way both the attempt to control the past through
          monumental structures and the failure of that effort.<sup id="fnref:341"><a href="#fn:341" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Here is the
          passage again in full:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
          Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
          Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
          hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.</p>
          
            <p>magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
          Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
          caeca regens filo uestigia. (<em>Aen</em>. 6.25-31)</p>
          
            <p>Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
          beneath [it] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
          the Minotaur, the <em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
          that toil of the house and the inescapable <em>error</em>. But indeed
          Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen’s great love unlocks the
          tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>To label the Minotaur as the “<em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus” would
          seem to exonerate Daedalus in the narrative he presents. As William
          Fitzgerald has suggested, in fact, the “configuration is notable for its
          absolute lack of Daedalus, who does not feature in Pasiphae’s
          escapade.”<sup id="fnref:342"><a href="#fn:342" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Indeed, although the master craftsman was the one who
          built the cow which allowed Pasiphae to copulate with the bull, he
          appears nowhere in this part of the doorframe. By presenting the story
          in this way, then, Daedalus is able to elide his own role from the
          Minotaur’s conception – making the creature the fault of a
          <em>Veneris…nefandae</em> (27). At the same time, however, by representing
          the Minotaur at all the artist fails to keep hidden the horrors of his
          own past. Instead of allowing this evil to lie concealed in the past
          Daedalus instead monumentalizes it for all to see and thus forever keeps
          his own <em>errores</em> on display regardless of the label that is given to
          the creature.<sup id="fnref:343"><a href="#fn:343" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The architect cannot escape from the horrible
          mistakes of his past even by providing a frame that re-interprets them
          in a way more sympathetic to him. Aestheticizing the past through
          <em>monumenta</em> cannot fully hide Daedalus’ mistakes, in other words, no
          matter how brilliant and mesmerizing those monumental golden doors
          appear.</p>
          
          <p>Before we move on to examining the <em>monumenta</em> of proto-Rome it seems
          relevant to note that while Daedalus’ selective depiction of the past
          can only be inferred from the passage discussed above, it becomes
          abundantly clear in the way that the master craftsman depicts (or rather
          does not depict) his dead son Icarus on the same doors.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…Tu quoque magnam
          partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes.
          bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro,
          bis patriae cecidere manus… (<em>Aen</em>. 6.30-33)</p>
          
            <p>You too would have an important part in so great a work, Icarus, were
          grief to allow it. Twice [Daedalus] had tried to fashion your fall
          in gold, twice the father’s hands fell…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In this passage Vergil explicitly tells the reader that Daedalus cannot
          fashion the fall of his son – an incident that is the fault of his
          creations yet again – for his hands cannot but fall (cf. <em>cecidere</em>, 33)
          when he tries to complete the frame.<sup id="fnref:344"><a href="#fn:344" class="footnote">9</a></sup> But Icarus is there,
          nonetheless, brought before the readers’ eyes by the poet himself
          through an apostrophe to the fallen boy.<sup id="fnref:345"><a href="#fn:345" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Whereas the absence of
          Daedalus from the frames above goes unmentioned by the poet, this final
          scene demonstrates more explicitly the way that the ingenious inventor
          is ultimately not able to keep hidden in his art the mistakes of his
          past. The conspicuous absence of Icarus that the poet notes transforms
          the doors into a monument not just to Daedalus’ dead son but also to the
          pain that he felt at having lost him. Vergil thus monumentalizes
          Daedalus’ grief for his son – even when it was the intention of the
          Athenian inventor to leave out of the frame the fall that he had caused
          for the pain it would bring him to reproduce it.</p>
          
          <p>By representing his story in the pictorial medium Daedalus is able to
          frame his past, giving it a kind of rigid structure. That does not mean,
          though, that he can control what others read back into that fictional
          frame. The events and details of his past that are not represented there
          can be made present by its interpreters even when Deadalus does not
          depict them – thus making it impossible for him to escape the past that
          he would clearly rather forget.<sup id="fnref:346"><a href="#fn:346" class="footnote">11</a></sup> He can try all he might to give a
          stable narrative to that past, to cover over its horrors in gold
          carvings. Yet the <em>monumenta</em> that the Minotaur represents within these
          frames can be read as symbolizing the <em>errores</em> of the artisan just as
          readily as they can be interpreted as the fault of “Venus.” In other
          words, the fact that the Minotaur is presented at all allows
          interpreters to read back into the myth those very mistakes that
          Daedalus might have wanted to leave out of his wondrous, intricate
          construction. In the end, therefore, even a master craftsman such as
          Daedalus is shown as unable to build a stable monument that would ease
          his suffering.<sup id="fnref:347"><a href="#fn:347" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The surface meaning of the monument – as the
          labyrinth itself – is not firm but can be broken down to reveal
          additional meanings that lie beneath its resplendent, magnificent
          surface.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>monumenta</em> that Anchises uses to interpret the prophecy of Apollo
          fail him, misleading him and his fellow Trojans into further <em>errores</em>.
          The <em>monumenta</em> that the Minotaur represents fail to save Daedalus from
          reliving his own <em>errores</em> of the past but instead perpetuate them. It
          should be no surprise, then, when problems of interpretation also
          accompany the only time when Vergil uses <em>monumenta</em> in an explicitly
          architectural sense, namely, in his description of the place that will
          one day become Rome.<sup id="fnref:348"><a href="#fn:348" class="footnote">13</a></sup> To whom are these structures “monuments”?
          Evander sees them as meaning one thing, Aeneas perhaps as meaning
          something else in his amazement. What about Roman readers, though? What
          do these incredibly ancient <em>monumenta</em> mean to them? In the passages
          analyzed below the problem is one a multiplicity of viewpoints that
          confuse or at the very least destabilize the meaning that the
          <em>monumenta</em> might have.</p>
          
          <p>Vergil introduces Aeneas’ famous “tour” Rome in Book 8 of the poem with
          the following passage:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…ibat rex obsitus aeuo
          et comitem Aenean iuxta natumque tenebat
          ingrediens uarioque uiam sermone leuabat.
          miratur facilisque oculos fert omnia circum
          Aeneas capiturque locis et singula laetus
          exquiritque auditque uirum monumenta priorum. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.307-312)</p>
          
            <p>The king went forth, besieged with age, and as he progressed he held
          Aeneas and his own son nearby as companions and lightened their way
          with various talk. Aeneas marvels and moves his eyes eagerly over all
          things. He is captivated by the places, happily asking and hearing one
          at a time about the <em>monumenta</em> of former men.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>What is at first simply a way to lighten the journey through
          conversation becomes something by which Aeneas is utterly “captivated”
          (<em>capitur</em>, 311) as he marvels at what he sees – much as he did in front
          of Daedalus’ Doors in Book 6.<sup id="fnref:349"><a href="#fn:349" class="footnote">14</a></sup> The difference in this case is that
          he has a guide to explain the different “monuments of former men”
          (<em>uirum monumenta priorum</em>, 312). But what exactly are these
          <em>monumenta</em>? The first “monuments” that Evander mentions are merely
          “groves” (<em>nemora</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 8.314) where the Nymphs and the first
          inhabitants of the place dwelled. The Greek king then goes on for 28
          lines to tell Aeneas about the way things used to be in the “golden age”
          of Saturn, when no laws were needed and everything was in abundance,
          before briefly explaining his own journey to the place itself and the
          founding of his city.<sup id="fnref:350"><a href="#fn:350" class="footnote">15</a></sup> If Evander is also a recent immigrant,
          though, how does he know the way things used to be in these lands which
          seem uninhabited upon his arrival except for the monster Cacus discussed
          in the previous chapter? Are these bare sites themselves all the
          “evidence” that remains of these events? Although there is only a hint
          of the ambiguity of meaning of these <em>monumenta</em> here, they set the tone
          for the rest of the passage which is likewise filled with such problems
          of perspective to an even greater degree.</p>
          
          <p>In the intervening lines before Evander speaks again Vergil narrates
          more of the tour that the king gives to Aeneas, pointing out several
          more “monuments” along the way:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…dehinc progressus monstrat et aram
          et Carmentalem Romani nomine portam
          quam memorant, nymphae priscum Carmentis honorem,
          uatis fatidicae, cecinit quae prima futuros
          Aeneadas magnos et nobile Pallanteum.
          hinc lucum ingentem, quem Romulus acer asylum
          rettulit…monstrat… (<em>Aen</em>. 8.337-343)</p>
          
            <p>Then having gone ahead he shows both the altar and the gate which the
          Romans call Carmental, the ancient honor of the Nymph Carmentis, the
          fate-speaking prophetess, who first sang that the sons of Aeneas would
          be great and Pallanteum would be noble. From this place he shows a
          vast grove, which the fierce Romulus restored as an asylum.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Evander shows Aeneas “the Carmentaline Gate” (<em>Carmentalem…portam</em>,
          338) and the immense “grove” (<em>lucum</em>, 342) which Romulus would come to
          use as an asylum. Yet these both appear to be anachronistic <em>monumenta</em>
          at least from the way that Vergil describes them. The Carmentaline Gate
          commemorates the “ancient honor” (<em>priscum…honorem</em>, 339) of the
          <em>vates</em> Carmens who first sang about the great sons of Aeneas and noble
          Pallanteum (the city that Evander and Aeneas are currently touring).
          While this edifice is thus a typical <em>monumentum</em> in the sense that it
          commemorates someone in the past, it is hard to know whether these words
          are Vergil’s commentary or a paraphrase of Evander’s own description.
          Does the king himself know that Carmens actually sang about the
          <em>Aeneadae</em>? It would seem likely since she is his mother, after all (cf.
          <em>Aen</em>. 8.335-336). If he does know of this prophecy, though, it would
          surely be strange that he has not already mentioned it to Aeneas and his
          <em>Aeneadae</em>. But regardless of whether or not this is Vergil’s paraphrase
          of Evander’s own words Aeneas is surely not seeing this <em>monumentum</em> in
          the same way as a Roman reader would from the future. The meaning of the
          monument for him (and Evander) is different from what it would have
          meant to Vergil’s Roman readers, who might know of these prophecies and
          their ultimate fulfillment from their perspective in the future.</p>
          
          <p>Admittedly, there might still be a certain amount of ambiguity regarding
          how much Evander knows about the Carmentaline Gate: he might know about
          the prophecy, or he might not. Any such uncertainty of how much
          knowledge Evander has of the “monuments” that he is showing to Aeneas
          disappears completely in the case of the second <em>monumentum</em> mentioned
          in this passage, namely, the asylum of Romulus. There is simply no way
          that Evander could know of Romulus; for the Greek ex-pat, at least, the
          grove can only be notable (if at all) because of its great size
          (<em>ingentem</em>, 342). And the same no doubt goes for Aeneas’ interpretation
          of this “monument,” as well. Only a reader of the epic would be able to
          interpret this grove for its historical value. This is not the only time
          on Evander’s tour that the reader encounters such an ambiguity of
          meaning between Rome’s past and present:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolia ducit
          aurea nunc, olim siluestribus horrida dumis. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.347-348)</p>
          
            <p>[Evander] leads [Aeneas] from here to the Tarpeian seat and the
          Capitoline, now golden, formerly bristling with forest-thorns.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The Tarpeian “seat” (<em>sedem</em>, 347) obviously cannot have any historical
          value to Evander; it would be another 500 years before Tarpeia would
          betray her city (cf. Liv. 1.11). And the Capitoline for the two of them
          is merely “bristling with forest-thorns” (<em>siluestribus horrida dumis</em>,
          348). This is not the case for a Roman reader, however, who as Vergil
          points out would have associated the Capitoline with the “now golden”
          (<em>aurea nunc</em>, 348) roofs of its buildings.<sup id="fnref:351"><a href="#fn:351" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>There are clearly some strange anachronisms that emerge from this
          passage.<sup id="fnref:352"><a href="#fn:352" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Vergil’s Augustan readers do not see the <em>monumenta</em> that
          Aeneas and Evander do in both a physical and historical sense.<sup id="fnref:353"><a href="#fn:353" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Yet
          Aeneas is said to “marvel” (<em>miratur</em>) at them – whatever they are – and
          “happily” (<em>laetus</em>, 8.311), too. Evander’s tour thus illustrates not
          only the way that <em>monumenta</em> can change meaning depending on their
          viewer; just as important, these passages shows that ignorance of what a
          monument means does not stop a viewer from enjoying them – as was noted
          above, for example, with the Trojans’ fateful enjoyment of the
          monumental Horse in Book II.<sup id="fnref:354"><a href="#fn:354" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It is the perspective of the viewer that ultimately gives these
          monuments their meaning(s). This is not say that these architectural
          “monuments” are “failures” in quite as an explicitly negative way as
          either the <em>monumenta</em> that Anchises (mis)remembers or the ones that
          Daedalus carves. The <em>monumenta</em> that Evander shows to Aeneas amaze and
          inspire the Trojan leader, after all. Nevertheless, when one takes into
          account the failures of the architectural structures analyzed in
          previous chapter and those of the <em>monumenta</em> in this chapter, it would
          not seem inappropriate to read the ambiguity of meaning that Evander’s
          “monuments” present in a less than positive light, as well. Although
          their external appearance (or name) might suggest a certain association,
          such an association is particular to the perspective of the onlooker –
          whether as a character in the poem, the narrator, or the reader. And
          different “readers” (including Aeneas and Evander) will no doubt bring
          their own interpretations. It is certainly the case, for instance, that
          the tour means something very different to a modern reader from what it
          might have meant to one who lived in Rome at the time that Vergil was
          writing.</p>
          
          <p>What these scenes from Evander’s tour therefore demonstrate to their
          readers is the way that architectural <em>monumenta</em> can amaze even when
          the audience does not fully understand what they mean. It would seem
          that sometimes only the outward appearance of monumentality – regardless
          of its meaning or what it commemorates – is enough for a structure to
          make an impact on its audience, or simply to appear monumental. Where
          these monuments “fail” is in the sense that without the proper knowledge
          of the past (or in Evander and Aeneas’ case the future) such structures
          or places can amaze but cannot impart the meaning they were perhaps
          meant to commemorate, whether good or bad.<sup id="fnref:355"><a href="#fn:355" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Without their stories
          these monuments still manage through their external appearance to cause
          their audiences to consider the significance of these spaces, even if
          only to be in awe of them; where they “fail” is in their inability to
          keep a stable frame on prior events which can help one to avoid
          repeating past <em>errores</em>. Who built the <em>monumenta</em> that Evander shows
          to Aeneas, one may ask, and more importantly what happened to them and
          their civilization so that all they leave behind in Evander’s time are
          these monumental “relics” (<em>reliquas</em>, 8.356)?<sup id="fnref:356"><a href="#fn:356" class="footnote">21</a></sup> Might it be that
          Rome could one day return to ruins whose original meaning no one would
          know? These are the kinds of questions that are raised when one
          considers these <em>monumenta</em> in the context of the other “failed”
          structures that the poem contains.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> has been shown in this chapter and the last one to be full
          of monumental structures whose very boundaries are revealed to be
          unstable, epistemologically as much as physically. Their awe-inspiring
          surfaces can cause one to forget what one should remember; or put in
          another way, their magnificent frames can keep hidden – and thus alive –
          that which one might want to forget. The same can be said for the
          architexture of the poem itself, as the next part of this chapter will
          now suggest.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2-vergilian-architexture-fractured-frames-of-meaning">Part 2. Vergilian Architexture: Fractured Frames of Meaning</h3>
          
          <p>The architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em> – both in its failed constructions and
          ambiguous <em>monumenta</em> – sets the foundation for a much different kind of
          architexture for Vergil than for Horace in his <em>Odes</em>. The epic poet
          focuses not so much on how to bring new elements into his generic
          boundaries without destabilizing them as on what happens when one tries
          to frame the violence and chaos of the past – and, in particular, Rome’s
          past – within the grand and monumental structure of epic that the proem
          of <em>Georgics</em> 3 suggested the <em>Aeneid</em> might be.<sup id="fnref:357"><a href="#fn:357" class="footnote">22</a></sup> As the balance of
          this chapter will show, however, the poem’s apparent failure in this
          regard is not nearly so important as the sophisticated representation of
          that failure which the <em>Aeneid</em> provides – as well as the lessons it can
          thereby offer to its readers, ancient and modern.</p>
          
          <p>The analysis of architecture and monuments in this chapter and the last
          one has demonstrated two issues that might arise when one attempts to
          construct an epic poem as a frame for the chaotic forces that are a part
          of Rome’s story from the start. Architectural constructions are
          repeatedly shown, on the one hand, as a means to contain chaotic forces
          of Rome’s past that would upset any order which one might try to impose
          upon them – and they are repeatedly shown to fail at keeping such forces
          restrained and hidden. The artificial boundaries placed upon the fury of
          the winds, the Greeks, and Cacus are ultimately broken and release such
          forces to wreak havoc on the world of Rome’s origins. Even the labyrinth
          (whether metaphoric or real) is shown to be ineffectual at keeping at
          bay such forces permanently – not only distracting the onlooker from the
          chaos contained through the complex artistry of its structure, but also
          forever monumentalizing the <em>errores</em> of the past in its shifting
          architectural frame that cannot be controlled.</p>
          
          <p>It is not just the chaos under the surface, on the other hand, that
          Vergil is bringing to light in the <em>Aeneid</em>. The poem’s failed
          <em>monumenta</em> also bring one’s attention to the problems with the
          magnificent frames placed upon such destructive forces. Neither those
          who produce nor those who receive such <em>monumenta</em> can give them a
          stable meaning which will endure. There are some meanings, moreover,
          that simply cannot be contained – even if one wants to forget them.
          Horace’s poetry showed how two opposed meanings can create a tension
          that allows a structure to evolve without its traditional boundaries
          being compromised. If a <em>monumentum</em> can have two meanings at once,
          however, who is to say it cannot have even more meanings – many more
          meanings – so many that those stable boundaries begin to crack?<sup id="fnref:358"><a href="#fn:358" class="footnote">23</a></sup>
          Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em> suggests a possible answer to that question. Its epic
          surface no matter how grand it might appear cannot in the end provide a
          stable frame for the chaos that inhabits Rome’s past and haunts its
          present.</p>
          
          <p>These two issues – the inefficacy of an epic frame to contain the
          destructive forces of the past and to maintain a single, stable meaning
          – are brought together in the poem’s final set of <em>monumenta</em>: the
          Baldric of Pallas. This object has also been seen as a <em>mise-en-abyme</em>
          of the poem itself in a way not dissimilar to Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> in
          the finale of his first collection of <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:359"><a href="#fn:359" class="footnote">24</a></sup> The belt is not
          architectural, of course. It does further illustrate, however, the way
          that a monument’s lack of stability in terms of its meaning can lead men
          to commit the same violent mistakes of the past by releasing the violent
          forces that it both commemorates and tries to frame. Its frame is
          revealed to be just as susceptible to “collapse,” in fact, as the
          boundaries of Aeolus’ Cave, the Trojan Horse, the Cave of Cacus, or the
          poem’s labyrinths – and with similar disastrous results when those
          boundaries fail. The baldric is “unique,” moreover, in that it is the
          only set of <em>monumenta</em> described at length in the poem that is also (in
          terms of its content at least) a part of an actual architectural
          monument in Augustan Rome, namely, the relief of the Danaids in the
          portico of Apollo’s temple on the Palatine.<sup id="fnref:360"><a href="#fn:360" class="footnote">25</a></sup> For these reasons,
          then, an analysis of the baldric’s <em>monumenta</em> will serve as a fitting
          way to conclude this investigation and come to some conclusions
          regarding Vergil’s monumental and “failed” architexture.</p>
          
          <p>When Turnus begs for his life after being wounded by Aeneas at the very
          end of the poem the Trojan leader hesitates for a moment (<em>cunctantem</em>,
          <em>Aen</em>. 12.940) as the words of the fallen native Italian begin to sway
          him to take pity. It is at that moment, however, that Aeneas sees that
          Turnus is wearing Pallas’ baldric – the sign of the enemy side
          (<em>inimicum insigne</em>, 12.944) – which Turnus not only took from the son
          of Evander after slaying him without mercy, but which he also
          re-appropriated for his own use. The sight of this piece of armor causes
          a strong reaction in Aeneas, as Vergil describes in the epic’s famous
          final lines:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>ille, oculis postquam saeui monumenta doloris
          exuuiasque hausit, furiis accensus et ira
          terribilis: tune hinc spoliis indute meorum
          eripiare mihi? Pallas te hoc uulnere, Pallas
          immolat et poenam scelerato ex sanguine sumit.”
          hoc dicens ferrum aduerso sub pectore condit
          feruidus; ast illi soluuntur frigore membra
          uitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras. (<em>Aen</em>. 12.945-952)</p>
          
            <p>[Aeneas], after he drank in the <em>monumenta</em> of savage grief and the
          spoils with his eyes, inflamed with furies and terrible in his wrath:
          “Will you be snatched away from me while dressed in the spoils of my
          own people? Pallas sacrifices you with this wound, Pallas exacts
          payment from your wicked blood.” Saying this, in a rage, he founds his
          sword in the opposed chest. Turnus’ limbs are loosened with cold and
          angrily his life flees with a groan down into the shadows.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>These <em>monumenta</em> represent the most complex set of “monuments” in the
          poem. Even more than with any of the monuments examined above there are
          in this passage multiple potential viewers and multiple people/events
          that the <em>monumenta</em> might be commemorating.<sup id="fnref:361"><a href="#fn:361" class="footnote">26</a></sup> First of all, for
          Aeneas, the baldric is a reminder not only of Pallas himself, but also
          of the “savage grief” (<em>saeui…doloris</em>, 945) that he feels at Turnus’
          act of slaying the young Greek.<sup id="fnref:362"><a href="#fn:362" class="footnote">27</a></sup> For Turnus, on the other hand,
          these are “spoils” (<em>exuuias</em>, 946; <em>spoliis</em>, 947) in which he formerly
          “rejoices and takes delight” (<em>ouat…gaudetque</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 10.500) when he
          rips them from Pallas’ dead body in Book 10; they are from his
          perspective simply a sign of his own military prowess. Turnus thus
          clearly interprets these <em>monumenta</em> rather differently from Aeneas. Yet
          there is another perspective to consider here, namely, that of the poet
          himself. When Turnus picks up the baldric in Book 10 the poet intrudes
          to lament humankind’s ignorance of the future:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae
          et seruare modum rebus sublata secundis!
          Turno tempus erit magna cum optauerit emptum
          intactum Pallanta et cum spolia ista diemque
          oderit. (<em>Aen</em>. 10.501-505)</p>
          
            <p>O the mind of mortals, unknowing of fate and future lot, ignorant of
          how to keep proper measure when lifted up by favorable affairs! There
          will be a time when Turnus will have wished he could buy the untouched
          body of Pallas at a great price, hating those damned spoils and the
          day.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>These “spoils” (<em>spolia</em>, 504) that for Turnus brought him such delight
          will soon cause him to regret his decision to strip Pallas’ corpse for
          plunder – let alone kill him in the first place. The poet’s lament for
          the inability of mortals to know the consequences of their actions here
          thus signals once again the inability of <em>monumenta</em> to maintain a
          stable meaning: the future will bring different viewers and thereby
          different interpretations to a single object – and this makes it
          impossible for that object have a single, stable way of understanding of
          it. The epistemological boundaries of these <em>monumenta</em> are not stable,
          in other words, but are constantly being broken down, re-interpreted,
          and built back up depending on the viewer.<sup id="fnref:363"><a href="#fn:363" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>There is still at least one more very important level, however, on which
          to interpret the <em>monumenta</em> of the baldric – one that has great
          significance for how to understand both its inability to keep in check
          the chaotic forces of the past and its instability of meaning. Vergil’s
          phrasing is somewhat ambiguous when he describes Aeneas’ actions as the
          Trojan hero looks at the baldric. As scholars have noted, the <em>saeui
          monumenta doloris</em> (945) that he takes in through his eyes can also
          refer to the images which have been engraved on the baldric.<sup id="fnref:364"><a href="#fn:364" class="footnote">29</a></sup> The
          reader is aware of the scene depicted on the sword-belt because when
          Turnus first strips the piece of armor from the dead Pallas the poet
          enters into a brief ecphrasis on its decoration:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…exanimem rapiens immania pondera baltei
          impressumque nefas: una sub nocte iugali
          caesa manus iuuenum foede thalamique cruenti,
          quae Clonus Eurytides multo caelauerat auro;
          quo nunc Turnus ovat spolio gaudetque potitus. (<em>Aen</em>. 10.496-500)</p>
          
            <p>…snatching the heavy weight of the baldric and the sin pressed upon
          it: during the course of a single wedding night a band of young men
          slain in sin and marriage chambers bloodied, which events Clonus, son
          of Eurytus, had engraved in much gold. And it is in this set of spoils
          which Turnus now rejoices and takes pleasure having obtained them.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The baldric frames the story of the Danaids who killed their husbands on
          their wedding night. Much scholarly attention has been given to the
          details of this description – and, in particular, its relation to the
          actual monument on the Palatine in Augustan Rome mentioned above which
          presents the same myth.<sup id="fnref:365"><a href="#fn:365" class="footnote">30</a></sup> The point I want to emphasize, however, is
          that Turnus does not seem to realize that by taking up the baldric he is
          also taking up “the sin pressed upon it” (<em>rapiens immania pondera
          baltei</em> / <em>impressumque nefas</em>, 10.496-497). His interpretation of the
          baldric as a set of spoils (<em>spolio</em>, 500) does not see past the thick
          layer of gold (<em>multo…auro</em>, 499) that frames – and thus in a sense
          covers over – the brutality of what is depicted. When Aeneas sees the
          baldric, though, he is said to “drink in with his eyes the <em>monumenta</em>
          of the cruel grief <em>and</em> the spoils” (cf. <em>oculis postquam saeui
          monumenta doloris</em> / <em>exuuiasque hausit</em>, 12.945-946), which suggests a
          different and more penetrating reading than seeing them only as
          <em>spolia</em>.<sup id="fnref:366"><a href="#fn:366" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Could it be that the savagery of events depicted stirs
          him to reject pity and slay the subdued Turnus?<sup id="fnref:367"><a href="#fn:367" class="footnote">32</a></sup> That is certainly
          not excluded by Vergil’s vague wording here.<sup id="fnref:368"><a href="#fn:368" class="footnote">33</a></sup> I would suggest that
          the poet allows for a reading of the scene whereby Aeneas is himself
          reading in the violence depicted on the baldric a reminder (or
          “monument”) to violence which then stirs him to take Turnus’ life.<sup id="fnref:369"><a href="#fn:369" class="footnote">34</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The <em>monumenta</em> of the baldric – whether the sword-belt itself or the
          images depicted on it – clearly do not have one stable meaning; they
          change meaning, rather, depending on who sees them and what exactly that
          viewer sees. These several, often competing meanings cause readers to
          re-evaluate constantly the boundaries of any single interpretation. The
          baldric thus very clearly “fails” as a monument in two related ways. It
          cannot maintain a single meaning, on the one hand, as Turnus cannot
          control the meaning of the baldric, and Aeneas cannot see the object
          without unleashing the violence it commemorates, whether intentionally
          or not.<sup id="fnref:370"><a href="#fn:370" class="footnote">35</a></sup> By looking at the play between surface and meaning, on the
          other hand, we can see that the baldric also fails to contain the chaos
          it depicts on it resplendent, golden exterior. The artistry of the frame
          does not matter: in the <em>Aeneid</em>, at least, that which bounds the fury
          inherent to Rome’s origins is shown as susceptible to collapse – and
          thereby to release the chaos inside. And for that reason Aeneas’
          violence-inducing interpretation of the baldric becomes perhaps the
          perfect way for Vergil to end his poem.<sup id="fnref:371"><a href="#fn:371" class="footnote">36</a></sup> It makes the baldric
          emblematic, I would argue, of a structure that pervades and perhaps even
          mirrors the entire poem, as the epic too fails to aestheticize in an
          unambiguous way the destruction and violent chaos of Rome’s past within
          its beautiful, highly-wrought, “golden” frame.<sup id="fnref:372"><a href="#fn:372" class="footnote">37</a></sup> What remains inside
          it is not a single truth but a chaotic force – one that not only breaks
          through the frame of the fiction that contains it to affect Aeneas but
          at the same time also reveals the fiction that any frame can safely
          contain such fury.<sup id="fnref:373"><a href="#fn:373" class="footnote">38</a></sup></p>
          
          <h3 id="part-3-reading-beneath-the-surface-of-augustan-monuments">Part 3. Reading Beneath the Surface of Augustan Monuments</h3>
          
          <p>Vergilian architexture is not so much about what a genre claims to
          exclude as what it can include – or rather tries to contain. Certain
          chaotic forces of Rome’s past cannot be tamed by an attempt to give them
          a facade of epic that seeks to frame those forces. This does not
          necessarily mean, however, that the poem is criticizing the grand
          monuments of the Augustan age as pure propaganda which needs to be seen
          through to the chaotic past they hide.<sup id="fnref:374"><a href="#fn:374" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Such an interpretation of
          the poem takes away from the complexity of meaning that the <em>Aeneid</em>
          highlights in dealing with monuments. The poem might suggest that there
          is something sinister lurking behind those glorious, travertine facades
          in Rome, something in the past that should not be forgotten lest it
          return to wreak havoc on the present. But it does so, I would argue, in
          order to make its readers into more effective readers of that past and
          better caretakers of their own future – not merely to destabilize the
          meaning of the present.</p>
          
          <p>The poem helps its readers (ancient and modern) to understand more fully
          what monuments can accomplish even in their apparent “failure.”
          Monuments allow us, on the one hand, to move into the future without
          forgetting the mistakes we have made in the past; that is often a
          significant part of their purpose, after all, according to Françoise
          Choay in her seminal study on the idea of monument in modernity.<sup id="fnref:375"><a href="#fn:375" class="footnote">40</a></sup>
          What the <em>Aeneid</em> shows us, on the other hand, is how the very failure
          of a monument to maintain a specific meaning and/or to conceal the
          horrors of the past can (paradoxically perhaps) achieve a similar
          effect: by exposing readers to such failures, by showing them the
          “cracks” in the facade of the epic structure, the poem is not claiming
          that monuments are useless; on the contrary, the <em>Aeneid</em> urges its
          readers through its failed architecture (and architexture) to see the
          need for understanding the flaws and limitations of such structures if
          one is to gain anything from them.</p>
          
          <p>The poem is therefore not quite demonstrating only the “impossibility of
          dictating artistic interpretation,” as Shadi Bartsch has
          suggested.<sup id="fnref:376"><a href="#fn:376" class="footnote">41</a></sup> Nor does it merely show the dangers of forgetting the
          past.<sup id="fnref:377"><a href="#fn:377" class="footnote">42</a></sup> The <em>Aeneid</em> should not be seen, moreover, as presenting
          only a complementary narrative to the monuments of the Augustan age
          because its “fictional framework allows a broader perspective on Roman
          history than the propagandistic monument.”<sup id="fnref:378"><a href="#fn:378" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Vergil crafts a
          <em>monumentum</em> whose architexture can both celebrate the past and the
          future while simultaneously making its readers aware <em>through</em> its
          failure of the <em>errores</em> of that past and the chaos that could break out
          at any moment in that future.<sup id="fnref:379"><a href="#fn:379" class="footnote">44</a></sup> It is thus very similar to the
          Temple of Janus that Jupiter describes in Book 1 of the poem: the Temple
          is also a monument that celebrates the current peace not by eradicating
          the <em>furor</em> of Rome’s past but by bounding it within its doors – gates
          barred tightly with iron, yes, but ones which also have the potential to
          be re-opened at any moment, releasing the chaos from the past that they
          contain.</p>
          
          <p>The poem can thus even become a <em>monumentum</em> that represents in its
          “failure” a strategy for interpreting other monuments of the Augustan
          age, as well. Augustus was certainly not ignorant of the sorts of
          problems that accompany the use of monuments. Chapter III has already
          suggested that the <em>princeps</em> presents a highly sophisticated
          understanding of the idea of the monument in his own <em>Res Gestae</em> that
          parallels Horace’s own complex use of the idea in the <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:380"><a href="#fn:380" class="footnote">45</a></sup> A
          similar case can be made here by examining other sections of Augustus’
          monumental inscription about his achievements. It is noteworthy, for
          instance, to look at what Augustus has to say regarding that same Temple
          of Janus mentioned several times throughout the past two chapters:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>[Ianum] Quirin[um quem cl[laussum ess[e maiores nostri
          voluer]runt, cum [p]er totum i[mperium pop]uli Roma[ni terra
          marique es]set parta victoriis pax, cum, pr[iusquam] nascerer, [a
          condita] u[rb]e bis omnino clausum [f]uisse prodatur
          m[emori]ae, ter me princi[pe senat]us claudendum esse censui[t].
          (<em>RGDA</em> 13)</p>
          
            <p>Although before I was born it is said that the temple of Janus
          Quirinus had been closed twice since the founding of the city – a
          temple which our ancestors wanted to be closed whenever peace had been
          won by victories through the whole empire of the Roman people on both
          land and sea – while I was <em>princeps</em> the senate ordered that it
          should be closed three times.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The point here is not just that Augustus has established peace more
          times during his rule alone than in all of Roman history combined. That
          is what the words say, of course. As the present study of the <em>Aeneid</em>
          has shown, however, monuments have a meaning beneath their surfaces, as
          well. Closing the doors does not mean that <em>furor</em> is gone forever; it
          is trapped, rather, and that should not be forgotten. Just as important
          as how many times Augustus has closed the doors is the fact that Rome
          has been at war for almost its entire history. <em>Furor</em> has always been a
          part of Rome’s story – the <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates that aspect of its
          history again and again in a time before Rome the city even existed.
          Augustus does not mention explicitly this fact but instead focuses on
          the positive: his birth signifies a new age where peace is finally
          possible.<sup id="fnref:381"><a href="#fn:381" class="footnote">46</a></sup> Again that does not mean that <em>Furor</em> has been
          eliminated, as even under Augustus’ reign the gates were closed and then
          re-opened.<sup id="fnref:382"><a href="#fn:382" class="footnote">47</a></sup> Yet it is that very acknowledgement – that Rome could
          fall into chaos again – which gives Augustus’ statement even more
          significance and power for his Roman readers. To close the gates so many
          times signifies a new age where peace can finally happen; the horrors of
          the past are still there, though, within the walls of the structure – no
          matter how grand it is, no matter how tightly shut it may be – ready to
          burst out at any moment.</p>
          
          <p>Reading Augustus’ words in this way suggests that while the <em>princeps</em>
          alone has been able to control and contain the <em>Furor</em> of Rome’s past,
          that containment might not last forever. It is precisely because this
          situation may only be temporary, though, that Romans therefore need
          Augustus (or his successor) to continue to be their <em>princeps</em> and keep
          chained the <em>Furor</em> of their past as Romans. And so it is to the
          Augustus’ advantage as well as their own for the readers of the <em>Res
          Gestae</em> and their newly monumental city to be able to see past the
          exterior of the temple and its closed doors, to be able to imagine the
          chaos that resides inside the architectural monument, that is, at least
          for the moment.</p>
          
          <p>It is possible to detect a similar destabilization of the surface in
          other Augustan monuments. The Ara Pacis has a much greater effect on its
          audience, for instance, when rather than seen as covering over the
          horrors of the recent past of civil strife such <em>errores</em> are imagined
          to exist right below its marble surface in such a way that the glorious
          present and future can be set in relief against them.<sup id="fnref:383"><a href="#fn:383" class="footnote">48</a></sup> Peace and
          concord mean much more, after all, when set against war and conflict. No
          one should blame Augustus for not depicting the horrors of Rome’s recent
          civil wars on Augustan monuments any more than anyone should criticize
          Daedalus for not carving his son’s death (for which he had some
          responsibility) on the doors of the temple of Apollo.<sup id="fnref:384"><a href="#fn:384" class="footnote">49</a></sup> What the
          <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates is how to look at what is not on the surface, as
          in the case of Daedalus’ failed <em>monumenta</em>, and to see what might be
          hard to take in but which is important not to forget lest Romans make
          the same mistakes again. Even when the chaos of the past is framed
          within Augustan architecture – as in the case of the Danaid friezes of
          his Temple of Apollo,<sup id="fnref:385"><a href="#fn:385" class="footnote">50</a></sup> or the depiction of a bound <em>Furor</em> in his
          own forum<sup id="fnref:386"><a href="#fn:386" class="footnote">51</a></sup> – those monuments gain more importance when seen not as
          merely portrayals of triumph over chaos but as reminders that such chaos
          could break free of its frame at any moment if Romans become complacent
          in times of peace and order. The poem shows its readers a way to
          interpret <em>monumenta</em> whereby one can be aware of their magnificent
          surfaces – of the order that they attempt to give to the events of
          history – and at the same time can understand that such frames do not
          tell the entire story, that it is the interpreter’s own task to inquire
          into the past, confronting head-on former <em>errores</em> and horrors of that
          past to understand how to keep them from repeating.</p>

          <p>I am not claiming that Vergil and Augustus were alone in having this
          perspective on monumental discourse of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:387"><a href="#fn:387" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Their
          fellow Romans could hardly turn a corner in the city without coming
          “face to face with the visual evidence of the contradictions and
          paradoxes which underlay the imperial system,” as the city of Rome was
          certainly “a realm of multiple perspectives and dramatic
          collisions.”<sup id="fnref:388"><a href="#fn:388" class="footnote">53</a></sup> Nor were historians such as Livy and elegiac poets
          such as Propertius unaware of the multiplicity of meaning that is
          inherent to monuments.<sup id="fnref:389"><a href="#fn:389" class="footnote">54</a></sup> What I am suggesting are the ways that the
          <em>Aeneid</em> is further exploring an element of monumental discourse in the
          Augustan age – one which can be found in the <em>Res Gestae</em> of Augustus
          himself – not inventing it wholesale, but both shaping it and being
          influenced by it.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> is a text that enwraps Rome’s past in an epic facade. It
          fails to accomplish this completely, however, letting the chaos that is
          a part of the Roman past break out at certain points in the poem,
          whether it be the winds of Aeolus or the Greeks in the Horse, whether it
          be the fury of the Trojan women on Sicily or the rage of Aeneas that
          ends the poem. It is a <em>monumentum</em> that forces its readers to focus not
          merely on what is on its surface but on what lies behind it, what past
          monsters of <em>Furor</em> exist within its boundaries. This is not because it
          seeks to undercut or “deconstruct” its facade – that would be a
          simplistic way of understanding the poem’s complex monumental
          architexture. The <em>Aeneid</em> shows its readers these “cracks” and allows
          them then to gain a fuller appreciation of the peaceful stability that
          Augustan monuments represent, as well as how fragile that peace can be
          should they forget what lies behind their magnificent facades.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> and its sophisticated architexture also points towards a
          development in the modern understanding of the monument during the
          twentieth century: an anxiety about what our monuments mean, or can
          mean, when we somehow have to confront the horrors of the past while
          still having hope that we can do better in our future.<sup id="fnref:390"><a href="#fn:390" class="footnote">55</a></sup> The poem
          proves, on the one hand, that this need for a double perspective is not
          just a modern phenomenon or problem. It does more, on the other hand,
          than just point to this anxiety. The <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates to its
          readers, ancient and modern, that it is only by acknowledging the
          capacity of monumental architecture to “fail” that we can truly
          appreciate the service it provides for us.<sup id="fnref:391"><a href="#fn:391" class="footnote">56</a></sup> The poem does not
          destabilize the meaning(s) that we give to monuments to no end by
          showing the flaws in their epistemological foundations. It is rather by
          showing “failure” to be inherent to the idea of the monument that the
          <em>Aeneid</em> can demonstrate how monuments might help us come to grips with
          our past – no matter how chaotic or full of violence – while also having
          the belief that we can learn from our mistakes and thereby do better in
          the present and future.<sup id="fnref:392"><a href="#fn:392" class="footnote">57</a></sup></p>

          justified act of vengeance that has both a personal and a public
          dimension. As for the latter, it suffices to quote Servius again,
          who clearly saw (<em>ad Aen.</em> 12.949) that it was <em>ultio foederis
          rupti</em> – revenge for the breaking of the treaty, a violation of
          divine and human law for which there was no clemency in Rome. This
          public aspect is complemented by Aeneas’ private obligation (an act
          of <em>pietas,</em> as Servius noted) to avenge the death of Evander’s son
          Pallas who had been entrusted to him.” In fact, Galinsky connects
          the baldric-as<em>-monumenta</em> to the Temple of Mars Ultor, which he
          claims was similarly a “monument to both Augustus’ private and

          both cases. “This paradoxical failure of art to contain,” according

                <p>See Choay 2001, 6-7: “The affective nature of [the monument’s]
          purpose is essential; it is not simply a question of informing, of
          calling to mind a neutral bit of information, but rather of stirring
          up, through the emotions, a living memory. In this original meaning,
          one would term a monument any artifact erected by a community of
          individuals to commemorate or to recall for future generations
          individuals, events, sacrifices, practices or beliefs. The
          specificity of the monument is therefore a direct function of the
          way it acts on memory. Not only does it mobilize and engage memory
          through the mediation of affectivity, in such a way as to recall the
          past while bringing it to life as if it were present. But the past
          that is invoked and called forth, in an almost incantatory way, is
          not just any past: it is localized and selected to a critical end,
          to the degree that it is capable of directly contributing to the
          maintenance and preservation of the identity of an ethnic,
          religious, national, tribal or familial community.” <a href="#fnref:375" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          in the political world is to banish the binary alternatives that
          ideology offers us, precisely by invoking the impossibility of
          dictating artistic interpretation even as Augustus begins his turn
          to an ideological artistic program at Rome. […] What the
          thriving industry of the interpretation of the <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates

          national future, its dread that Roman history cannot escape from a
          destructive repetition compulsion. But perhaps Virgil realized that
          his poem, by contributing to an official program of historical
          revision and mythification, might produce the very effect it sought
          to avoid. By forgetting its past, Virgil’s Rome is condemned to

          in the late 20s BCE while the <em>Aeneid</em> was being composed. The
          argument I am makin here (unlike Harrison’s) is not dependent on
          whether such a work was a part of the Forum before or after the
          completion of the epic poem: Vergil is not so much discussing

          different things to different people or to the same people at
          different times or in different contexts” (34). For the way that
          Livy uses monuments in his history see Jaeger 1997, <em>passim</em>, and
          esp. 11-12: “When monuments fail and the text restores them,
          reminders of stories give way to stories about reminders. By drawing
          attention to the [Livy’s] reconstructive activity, the restored
          monuments [in the <em>Ab urbe condita</em>] commemorate his recollection
