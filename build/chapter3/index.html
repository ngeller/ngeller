      <article class='page'>
        <main class='page-content'>
          <p>Horace is a poet of structure.<sup id="fnref:120"><a href="#fn:120" class="footnote">1</a></sup> And no more so than in his <em>Odes</em>.
          Scholars again and again refer to his poems using architectural
          vocabulary.<sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It is almost more of a surprise, in fact, when a
          scholar of Horace does <em>not</em> discuss the “structure” of an individual
          poem, of a single book, or of the collection as a whole. This sense of
          structure can include the more literal way that different poems are
          arranged within and between themselves, that is, the “architectonics” of
          Horace’s poetry. The idea of structure can also extend beyond this
          organizational sense, though, to the more metaphorical ways in which
          Horace has “constructed” his <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote">3</a></sup> In Gregson Davis’ study of
          the complexities of the Horatian lyric voice, for instance, he considers
          the <em>Odes</em> to be “an ideational building, which it is part of the
          business of the critic to reconstruct.”<sup id="fnref:123"><a href="#fn:123" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This use of architectural discourse to discuss Horace’s <em>Odes</em> is no
          accident. The poet himself famously proclaims his first collection of
          lyric poetry to be a <em>monumentum</em> – one higher than the pyramids no less
          – and this image has influenced how readers (and scholars) thereafter
          have understood and imagined the <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote">5</a></sup> This chapter will look at
          the “structure” of the <em>Odes</em>, too, but not in the sense of a lyric
          collection with a brilliant design of lines, poems, and books. Nor will
          I be using architectural metaphors only to introduce or summarize – as
          Davis does – how I as a scholar of the <em>Odes</em> might read Horace’s lyric
          corpus. The focus of this chapter is rather to examine Horace’s
          architexture, that is, the architectural imagery that the poet himself
          employs to represent the generic limits of his poetry. The point of this
          analysis is not merely to admire or praise Horace’s amazing “structure,”
          as so many rightly have. I aim rather to show how engaging in
          architectural discourse of this sort allows the poet to redefine
          “traditional” lyric space and time in a way that puts him in dialogue
          with Augustus’ own redefinition of traditional Roman structures in the
          language of the <em>Res Gestae</em>.</p>
          
          <p>What is “traditional” lyric time and space in the <em>Odes</em>? It is not
          simply the dimensions that Horace’s lyric predecessors, Greek and Roman,
          had crafted in their poems. Horace was starting fresh in the sense that
          when he “decided to compose lyric, despite experimentation by
          Callimachus, Theocritus, Laevius, and Catullus,<sup id="fnref:125"><a href="#fn:125" class="footnote">6</a></sup> the kind was dead,
          that is, there was no living tradition of lyric to generate some sort of
          ‘natural,’ rule-generating form.”<sup id="fnref:126"><a href="#fn:126" class="footnote">7</a></sup> What counted as “traditional”
          was therefore open to interpretation and debate – just as it was in the
          politics and culture of the Augustan age more broadly.<sup id="fnref:127"><a href="#fn:127" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Horace
          defined the spatio-temporal limits of his lyric not so much with an eye
          to past lyric, I would argue, as with an ear to the discourse regarding
          the redefinition of traditional Roman structures in his present. In what
          I will suggest was a particularly Augustan move the poet built his lyric
          structure to be simultaneously “traditional” <em>and</em> innovative enough to
          have extrageneric material as part of its definition. As this chapter
          will demonstrate, moreover, Horace accomplished this seemingly
          paradoxical construction through a delicate balancing of apparent
          opposites to be in perfect tension with each other: the private,
          personal <em>hic et nunc</em> (“here and now”) of his lyric, on the one hand,
          and the public, political dimensions of epic that he claims are
          unfitting for his lyre, on the other.<sup id="fnref:128"><a href="#fn:128" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Therefore, while Horace’s Greek lyric predecessors are important to his
          <em>Odes</em>,<sup id="fnref:129"><a href="#fn:129" class="footnote">10</a></sup> and their poetry forms the basis for many of the poems
          (and their meters) in the corpus,<sup id="fnref:130"><a href="#fn:130" class="footnote">11</a></sup> I will not be looking directly
          at their influence for the present analysis. Horace was engaging in a
          poetic enterprise which was radically different from any that his
          precursors, Greek or Roman, had attempted in this poems<sup id="fnref:131"><a href="#fn:131" class="footnote">12</a></sup> – an
          enterprise that was very much in tune with his own moment in Augustan
          Rome. As Paul Allen Miller puts it, “[t]he creation of a private
          poetry which ultimately engages the public realm, without becoming the
          discourse of the state, requires the presence of… [a] set of social,
          technological, and political conditions which separates Horace’s world
          from that of his Lesbian predecessors.”<sup id="fnref:132"><a href="#fn:132" class="footnote">13</a></sup> This chapter will show how
          Horace’s architexture reflects these particular “conditions” in the way
          it redefines traditional lyric space and time to include extrageneric
          (especially epic) material which might seem inappropriate or even
          opposed to it.</p>
          
          <p>This particular opposition between traditional lyric dimensions and the
          extrageneric ones of epic is given concrete form in the <em>Odes</em> through a
          specific juxtaposition of contrasting architectural structures. Horace’s
          traditional lyric space-time is represented often by the figure of the
          poet’s own Sabine farm<sup id="fnref:133"><a href="#fn:133" class="footnote">14</a></sup> – a modest dwelling from a simpler time
          that seems perfect for housing the self-proclaimed Callimachean nature
          of his lyric.<sup id="fnref:134"><a href="#fn:134" class="footnote">15</a></sup> In contrast to this humble structure of the poet
          stands the excessively luxurious, expansive, and “modern” (cf.
          <em>novo…ritu</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.1.45-46) villas of the Roman elite that appear in
          many poems of the corpus but receive special attention in <em>C</em>. 2.18 and
          3.1. Horace warns again and again against building such edifices: they
          cause their owners, the poet implies, to lose a sense of the lyric here
          and now – owners who are always off on some epic-like quest over the sea
          to quarry stone from some far off land to show off one day in their
          atriums, or perhaps constructing some monumental structure that (they
          believe) will stave off their inevitable deaths. Through establishing
          this set of opposing structures – the light, contained lyric farm of the
          poet and the massive, transgressive epic estates of the wealthy – Horace
          is able to establish the spatio-temporal limits of his <em>Odes</em> in a way
          that seems “traditional” to his Roman readers, especially in how they
          align with good old Roman <em>mores</em> regarding the luxury (or lack thereof)
          in one’s own house.<sup id="fnref:135"><a href="#fn:135" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Yet there is a problem with a simple dichotomy between Horace’s own
          rural structure and those of the rich villa owners whom he criticizes:
          this binary opposition does not appear, at least initially, to leave any
          room at all for the famous architextural structure of the poet presented
          in the finale to his first collection of <em>Odes</em>. There Horace proclaims
          that the <em>monumentum</em> of his lyric poetry will soar “loftier than the
          royal structure of the pyramids” (<em>regali</em>…<em>situ pyramidum altius</em>,
          <em>C</em>. 3.30.2); more than that, the structure will exist outside of the
          temporal boundaries that nature imposes on everything man-made through
          its “decaying rain” and the “flight of ages” (<em>imber edax</em>…<em>fuga
          temporum</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.3-5). Horace even goes so far as to state that
          through his <em>monumentum</em> he “will not die completely” (<em>non omnis
          moriar</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.6). How could the same Horace who tells his reader to
          “forget about the pointless honors of a tomb” (<em>sepulcri</em> / <em>mitte
          supervacuos honores,</em> <em>C</em>. 2.20.23-24) at the end of the previous book
          suddenly turn around at the conclusion of Book 3 and claim to have
          erected a <em>monumentum</em> grander than even the pyramids? All this is
          suggestive of the mindset of those same villa owners whom he reprimands
          throughout the <em>Odes</em> for forgetting the enjoyment of the lyric “here
          and now.”<sup id="fnref:136"><a href="#fn:136" class="footnote">17</a></sup> It would appear, then, that at the very edge of his
          lyric corpus Horace transgresses the boundaries established through his
          own small estate and ventures into building an architextural structure
          whose dimensions he formerly rejected as antithetical to his
          lyric.<sup id="fnref:137"><a href="#fn:137" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>I argue in this chapter that this transgressive <em>monumentum</em> is in fact
          the perfect symbol for Horace’s architexture. The “tension” found in the
          <em>Odes</em> between the two opposed architextural styles of the farm and the
          transgressive villa is not a problem to be solved, but rather is an
          essential to the ultimate success of Horace’s redefinition of
          “traditional” lyric. This tension is not an accident, moreover, but the
          intended result of a rhetorical strategy that Horace uses repeatedly in
          the <em>Odes</em> to introduce extrageneric material from epic into his lyric
          without destabilizing its lyric foundations – a rhetorical device that I
          call an “inverted” <em>recusatio</em> (“refusal”). The paradigmatic <em>recusatio</em>
          involves a poet who is told by some divine figure not to write
          epic.<sup id="fnref:138"><a href="#fn:138" class="footnote">19</a></sup> In Horace’s <em>Odes</em>, though, it is the poet <em>himself</em> who
          often feels he has to restrain his Muse who has wandered off into very
          non-lyric territory which the poet then describes at length. Through
          this device, I suggest, Horace is able to offset the innovations he is
          making to traditional lyric space and time through the inclusion of
          extrageneric material in such a way that his structure remains stable
          even as it is redefined – a process that Horace’s <em>monumentum</em>
          represents perfectly in its own seemingly paradoxical ability to be both
          stable and dynamic.</p>
          
          <p>This chapter will be divided into four parts. The first will briefly
          examine the Augustan <em>recusatio</em> with a view to the ways in which Horace
          inverts the typical formula of the trope in his <em>Odes</em>, as well as his
          potential reasons for doing so. The next part will deal with how Horace
          uses this trope to bring extrageneric space and time in tension with the
          lyric dimensions of his farm so as to revitalize while also altering the
          structure of “traditional” lyric. The third part will turn to <em>C</em>. 3.30
          to suggest that these tensions within the poet’s architexture are
          represented there, as well, in a monument which is both more stable than
          anything ever constructed and yet constantly changing. Finally, the
          fourth part will explore how Horace’s redefinition of “traditional”
          lyric in his poetry mirrors strategies employed by Augustus himself in
          the <em>Res Gestae</em> to redefine the traditional structures of Rome, both
          literal and metaphorical.<sup id="fnref:139"><a href="#fn:139" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
          
          <h3 id="part-1-the-inversion-of-the-recusatio-in-horace">Part 1. The Inversion of the <em>Recusatio</em> in Horace</h3>
          
          <p>Although the <em>recusatio</em> was a common trope that many Augustan poets
          employed to “extricate themselves from the expected imposition” to write
          epics on the military exploits of Augustus,<sup id="fnref:140"><a href="#fn:140" class="footnote">21</a></sup> the rhetorical device
          takes its cue from the programmatic opening of Callimachus’ highly
          influential <em>Aitia</em>.<sup id="fnref:141"><a href="#fn:141" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In the prologue to that Hellenistic work the
          narrator claims that Apollo himself appeared to him as he was about to
          compose a poem. The god then told the poet that he should “raise [his]
          sacrificial victim to be as fat as possible – but nurture [his] Muse
          to be slender” (τὸ μὲν θύος ὅττι πάχιστον / θρέψαι, τὴ]ν Μοῦσαν δ’
          ὠγαθὲ λεπταλέην, <em>Aitia</em> fr. 1.23-24). And it was this particular
          version of “divine intervention” that was then to establish the standard
          formula for the <em>recusatio</em> which the Augustan poets would take up over
          two centuries later at Rome: a divine being appears to the poet, forbids
          him from engaging in epic flight, and suggests instead that he should
          keep to light matters and meters.</p>
          
          <p>The earliest full Latin example we have of such a <em>recusatio</em> appears in
          Vergil’s <em>Eclogues</em> where it is a humble shepherd – as a stand-in for
          the poet himself – who first sounds the strain of “refusal”:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
          uellit, et admonuit: “Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
          pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen.”
          nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
          Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
          agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam.
          non iniussa cano… (Verg. <em>Ecl</em>. 6.3-9)</p>
          
            <p>When I was starting to sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my
          ear, and warned me: “Tityrus, it is fitting for the shepherd to make
          his sheep fat, to utter a song finely spun.” Now I (and for there will
          be others, Varus, who will wish to tell your praises and compose poems
          about gloomy wars) will practice the rustic Muse on a slender reed.
          The songs I sing are not unordered…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The standard formula that begins with Callimachus is illustrated
          perfectly here: the divine Apollo appears to the poet, tells him to
          forget about epic, and advises that he focus instead on singing a
          finely-spun song (cf. <em>oportet</em>…<em>deductum dicere carmen</em>, 5). As the
          premier instance of the trope in surviving Latin poetry, it has been
          argued, this Vergilian <em>recusatio</em> helped to cement the Callimachean
          version as the prototype for Roman poets to follow.<sup id="fnref:142"><a href="#fn:142" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>In the poetry of Horace, however, there is something that seems off
          about his “refusals,” for they do not seem to be proper refusals at all.
          Steele Commager was right to assert that the Horatian <em>recusatio</em> is a
          bit peculiar. “The <em>recusatio</em> was of course a common form,” Commager
          begins, “but in Horace’s hands it usually becomes equivalent to the
          rhetorician’s <em>praeteritio</em>.”<sup id="fnref:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote">24</a></sup> In the introductory poem to his
          Second Book of <em>Satires</em>, for example, Horace sets himself in dialogue
          with an interlocutor who advises him that he <em>should</em> write epic only to
          have Horace respond by declining the offer – all the while giving a
          rather “descriptive catalogue”<sup id="fnref:144"><a href="#fn:144" class="footnote">25</a></sup> of those same epic themes that he
          is disavowing:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>“…aut si tantus amor scribendi te rapit, aude
          Caesaris invicti res dicere, multa laborum
          praemia laturus.” “cupidum, pater optime, vires
          deficiunt; neque enim quivis horrentia pilis
          agmina nec fracta pereuntis cuspide Gallos
          aut labentis equo describit vulnera Parthi.” (Hor. <em>Sat</em>.
          2.1.10-15)<sup id="fnref:145"><a href="#fn:145" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
          
            <p>“Or if so great a love of writing snatches you, dare to utter the
          deeds of the unconquerable Caesar – and you will carry off many
          rewards for your labors.” “Though I desire it, my good sir, my
          strength fails me; for not just anyone at all can describe the battle
          lines bristling with spears, nor the Gauls dying when the points of
          their spears have been broken, or the wounds of a Parthian falling
          from his horse.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This passage contains not only an “inversion” of the typical formula –
          in that the one addressing the poet is actually <em>encouraging</em> him to
          write epic – but also demonstrates how such an inverted <em>recusatio</em> can
          offer the poet a chance to “commandeer his language from the subjects he
          rejects.”<sup id="fnref:146"><a href="#fn:146" class="footnote">27</a></sup> In other words, the poet employs a catalog of epic
          themes to give the reader the sense that he is more than adequate at
          doing the very thing he professes that he cannot.<sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Horace’s <em>Odes</em> extends this function of the trope even further. The
          poet inverts the procedure of the <em>recusatio</em> in a still more remarkable
          manner by at times reprimanding his own Muse for overstepping the
          boundaries of his lyric domain. In the introductory poem of <em>Odes</em> 2,
          for instance, Horace starts by discussing the gloomy nature of Pollio’s
          works on the civil wars; he reproduces so much epic-sounding material,
          however, that the poet then feels compelled to “reel in” his own Muse
          before he can end the poem,<sup id="fnref:148"><a href="#fn:148" class="footnote">29</a></sup> as the passage below demonstrates:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Sed ne relictis, Musa procax, iocis
          Ceae retractes munera neniae,
          mecum Dionaeo sub antro
          quaere modos leuiore plectro. (Hor. <em>C</em>. 2.1.37-40)</p>
          
            <p>But lest you, my naughty Muse, take up again the rites of the Cean
          dirge leaving behind all jokes, seek measures on a lighter instrument
          with me within the cavern of Venus.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In this passage it is Horace himself – and not some divine being – who
          instructs <em>his</em> Muse to behave herself and stick to light topics that
          are more fitting for light meters. This is not the last glimpse we get
          of Horace’s <em>procax</em> Muse, though. In Book 3 the poet again feels his
          Muse has begun to slip out of his control after he has sung about a
          council of the gods in which Juno delivers a lengthy (and epic-sounding)
          prophecy for Rome. Here is the poet’s address to his Muse at the poem’s
          conclusion:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae:
          quo, Musa, tendis? desine pervicax
          referre sermones deorum et
          magna modis tenuare parvis. (<em>C</em>. 3.3.69-72)</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>This will not be fitting for my playful lyre: where are you heading,
          my Muse? Intractable! Cease to report the speeches of gods and to
          diminish great things with your small measures.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In both of these passages it is not the usual divine being that comes to
          Horace to turn him away from the epic mode; it is rather the poet
          himself who confronts his Muse – not for inspiration, as one might
          expect, but to restrain her from going into generic territory (cf.
          <em>Ceae…neniae</em>; <em>magna</em>) which is unfitting for his light lyric poetry
          (cf. <em>leviore plectro</em>; <em>iocosae…lyrae</em>; <em>modis… parvis</em>).<sup id="fnref:149"><a href="#fn:149" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It should be clear by now what I mean by “inverted” <em>recusatio</em> when
          comparing the Horatian art of “refusal” to the typical formula employed
          by other poets. But why does Horace invert the trope in the first place?
          What does the poet gain by transfiguring the <em>recusatio</em> formula in such
          a way? Commager recognized the tension that such “refusals” produce, but
          never fully resolved it. “Horace stands as the classic example,” he
          writes,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>of the man who manages to eat his cake and have it too. Indulging the
          most extravagant of pastoral fantasies, he escapes charges of
          sentimentality; dispensing moral unction, he avoids the reproach of
          sermonizing; rising to an epic grandeur, he denies pretensions to
          sublimity; summoning all wealth’s sensuous reality, he receives credit
          for banishing it.<sup id="fnref:150"><a href="#fn:150" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>And the scholar ends his discussion of the tension there. Peter Smith
          also left the matter of this “tension” only “partially solved” by his
          own admittance.<sup id="fnref:151"><a href="#fn:151" class="footnote">32</a></sup> For Smith the tension is one that
          (unsatisfactorily even to him) seems to be located within the historical
          person of the poet himself: “in the <em>recusatio</em>, the slender poet had
          shown an irresistible tendency to soar, for all his reticence. […]
          Though he had learned to live with the conflicting drives of self and
          state, Horace was never altogether comfortable.”<sup id="fnref:152"><a href="#fn:152" class="footnote">33</a></sup> The main issue I
          take with these approaches (besides the obvious biographical fallacy
          which motivates Smith’s reading) is that they consider this “tension” to
          be a problem which needs to be solved rather than a crucial component of
          how Horace constructs his particular lyric structure, as I will suggest
          below.</p>
          
          <p>Gregson Davis, Michèle Lowrie, and Stephen Harrison have each attempted
          in more recetn decades to provide a more nuanced approach to this same
          tension through their respective studies on the rhetorical posturing of
          Horatian lyric.<sup id="fnref:153"><a href="#fn:153" class="footnote">34</a></sup> Their answers focus on how Horace uses these
          moments to introduce extrageneric material into his lyric poetry –
          whether through what they term generic “assimilation,” “negation,” or
          “enrichment,” respectively. Davis suggests that “the supposed aim of
          ‘refusal’ probably masks an intent to <em>incorporate</em>, rather than utterly
          repudiate, matter traditionally regarded as alien to a particular
          literary orientation,” with the result that Horace can then “assimilate”
          other genres through disavowing their material.<sup id="fnref:154"><a href="#fn:154" class="footnote">35</a></sup> The idea of
          “generic enrichment” that Harrison has put forth more recently does not
          differ much from Davis’ understanding of these disavowels: “generic
          enrichment,” as Harrison defines it, is “the way in which generically
          identifiable texts gain literary depth and texture from detailed
          confrontation with, and consequent inclusion of elements from, texts
          which appear to belong to other literary genres.” <sup id="fnref:155"><a href="#fn:155" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Neither of
          these scholars looks outside of Horace’s lyric world for the motivation
          behind these rhetorical gestures.<sup id="fnref:156"><a href="#fn:156" class="footnote">37</a></sup> In contrast to these studies
          Lowrie’s reading of Horace’s “disavowals” does extend beyond the poetic
          implications and into the political realities of the Augustan age.
          Although she also claims that Horace’s “poetry defines itself largely by
          saying what it is not,” Lowrie convincingly argues that this
          “tug-of-war…surpasses the formal conflict within the aesthetic realm, to
          encompass that between aesthetics and ideology.”<sup id="fnref:157"><a href="#fn:157" class="footnote">38</a></sup> While Lowrie’s
          approach does then help to show how Horace’s project of lyric definition
          interacts with elements of Augustan ideology, it does not go deeper to
          explore fully how the poet is also engaging with the very ways in which
          that ideology was itself promoted<sup id="fnref:158"><a href="#fn:158" class="footnote">39</a></sup> – as it was through Augustus’
          own <em>Res Gestae</em>, for instance, in the ways I will suggest in Part 4
          below.</p>
          
          <p>I would like to acknowledge at the outset that scholars have touched
          obliquely upon a possible connection between the respective rhetorical
          stances of the poet and the <em>princeps</em>.<sup id="fnref:159"><a href="#fn:159" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Karl Galinsky’s reading of
          the repeated use of <em>recusatio</em> in the <em>Odes</em> probably comes closest to
          some of the conclusions I arrive at in this chapter in that he also sees
          the kind of rhetorical “refusals” that Augustus makes in the <em>Res
          Gestae</em> as a source of indirect “inspiration” for the poet.<sup id="fnref:160"><a href="#fn:160" class="footnote">41</a></sup> The
          scholar spends only a paragraph on this idea, however, and does not
          fully develop the parallel. Nor does he look at what either Augustus or
          Horace has to say about architecture in this context – which will be the
          main focus of my comparison between the two at the end of this chapter.</p>
          
          <p>Before I can discuss the nuances of this parallel, however, it will
          first be necessary to work through the complex nature of Horace’s own
          architexture in the <em>Odes</em>. The next two sections of this chapter builds
          on the scholarship discussed above to ask not just <em>how</em> Horace defines
          traditional lyric space and time, but also <em>why</em> he does it in the
          precise way he does, that is, through a delicate balancing of the two
          opposed architextural images of his farm and the transgressive Roman
          villas he criticizes. It is by recognizing the importance of this
          tension, I suggest, that one can better understand how Horace’s
          <em>monumentum</em> in <em>C</em>. 3.30 is a perfect metaphor not only for his own
          poems, but just as much for the age of redefinition in which he
          constructs it – an age when the seemingly paradoxical idea that one
          could redefine what was “traditional” became an important way for the
          <em>princeps</em> to articulate what it meant to be Roman.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2-transgressive-architexture-in-the-odes">Part 2. Transgressive Architexture in the <em>Odes</em></h3>
          
          <p>The latter half of Horace’s second book of <em>Odes</em> and the beginning of
          the third contain several poems that discuss excessive architectural
          structures. The focus of this section will be on the most extensive of
          such discussions, namely, <em>C</em>. 2.18 and 3.1. Although Horace in these
          poems might seem to portray grand, ostentatious architecture in an
          unappealing light in contrast to his modest Sabine farm, it is by
          claiming to disavow such transgressive structures that the poet is
          actually able to make them a part of his traditional lyric space and
          time. Let us start with the beginning of <em>C</em>. 2.18:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Non ebur neque aureum
          mea renidet in domo lacunar,
          non trabes Hymettiae
          premunt columnas ultima recisas
          Africa, neque Attali 5
          ignotus heres regiam occupavi
          […]
          …nihil supra
          deos lacesso nec potentem amicum
          largiora flagito,
          satis beatus unicis Sabinis. (<em>C</em>. 2.18.1-6, 11-14)</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>An ivory and golden ceiling does not shine in my house, Hymettian
          beams do not press upon columns quarried from the ends of Africa, nor
          have I as the unknowing heir to an Attalus come in the possession of a
          palace […] I bother the gods for nothing more, nor do I demand
          anything more lavish from my powerful friend, content enough as I am
          with my unique Sabine holdings.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This opening priamel should come as no surprise for readers of Horace:
          not only is it an “imitation” of Bacchylides fr. 21;<sup id="fnref:161"><a href="#fn:161" class="footnote">42</a></sup> the theme of
          excessively luxurious architecture should be rather familiar by the time
          one reaches this poem near the end of Book 2.<sup id="fnref:162"><a href="#fn:162" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Horace has devoted
          many lines already to criticizing such structures and the problems that
          accompany them. In <em>Odes</em> 2.10, for instance, he warns against “halls
          inciting envy” (<em>invidenda…aula</em>, 7-8). <em>C</em>. 2.15 begins with a lament
          that “regal structures soon will leave a few acres for the plough” (<em>iam
          pauca aratro iugera regiae</em> / <em>moles relinquent</em>, 1-2) – quite in
          contrast to the traditional Roman way of life that the poet discusses in
          the latter half of that poem (cf. <em>C.</em> 2.15.10-20). As Horace then notes
          in <em>C</em>. 2.16, such structures only serve to make one more anxious with
          all “the cares that flitter about paneled ceilings” (<em>curas laqueata
          circum</em> / <em>tecta volantis</em>, 11-12). It should not be unexpected
          therefore to find Horace ranting against such architecture at the
          beginning of <em>C</em>. 2.18, as he relates all those trappings of luxury
          which are <em>not</em> in his own house, including a ceiling of ivory and gold
          (<em>ebur…aureum</em>…<em>lacunar</em>, 1-2), marble beams (<em>trabes Hymettias</em>, 3),
          and columns quarried from the ends of Africa (<em>columnas ultima recisas</em>
          / <em>Africa</em>, 4-5).</p>
          
          <p>It is not just the luxury itself that is the problem, however, as much
          as the excessive and <em>transgressive</em> nature of building such a “palace”
          (<em>regiam</em>, <em>C.</em> 2.18.6).<sup id="fnref:163"><a href="#fn:163" class="footnote">44</a></sup> Taking marble from a distant locale is
          not the only way that these villa owners seek to extend their boundaries
          across and beyond natural boundaries.<sup id="fnref:164"><a href="#fn:164" class="footnote">45</a></sup> The poet goes on to accuse
          the rich of “greedily tear[ing] down the boundary stones of [their]
          land and leap[ing] beyond the borders of [their] clients” (<em>revellis
          agri terminos et ultra</em> / <em>limites clientium</em> / <em>salis avarus</em>, <em>C</em>.
          2.18.24-26); even worse, these avaricious individuals desire to extend
          their villas so as “to drive back the shores of the sea, being too
          little rich themselves since the shore restrains them”
          (<em>maris</em>…<em>summovere</em> <em>litora</em>, / <em>parum locuples continente ripa</em>,
          <em>C</em>. 2.18.20-22, cf. <em>C</em>. 3.1.34-38). Both of these actions are examples
          of what Ellen Oliensis has called a “debauched imperialism” in which
          “formal, spatial, and moral boundaries all give way at once”<sup id="fnref:165"><a href="#fn:165" class="footnote">46</a></sup> – not
          to mention natural and social ones.<sup id="fnref:166"><a href="#fn:166" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>What scholars have paid less attention to here are the generic
          boundaries being crossed with the specific and marked image of extending
          one’s villa into the sea – a space in the <em>Odes</em> which has often been
          read as “a recurrent image for unsettledness and danger.”<sup id="fnref:167"><a href="#fn:167" class="footnote">48</a></sup> The
          various reasons to sail on the sea – for trade, for making money, for
          expanding one’s power – all present values that oppose the quiet life of
          <em>autarkeia</em> that Horace imagines for himself in several poems of the
          collection,<sup id="fnref:168"><a href="#fn:168" class="footnote">49</a></sup> including the very first one with its famous opening
          priamel (cf. <em>C.</em> 1.1.11-14). As the reader learns only shortly later in
          <em>C</em>. 1.3, moreover, the very act of sailing is a “crime” (<em>nefas</em>, 26)
          against the natural order of things: “The prudent god divided the lands
          from the discordant Ocean in vain, if impious ships still sail over
          waters that are not to be touched” (<em>nequiquam deus abscidit</em> / <em>prudens
          Oceano dissociabili</em> / <em>terras, si tamen impiae</em> / <em>non tangenda rates
          transiliunt vada</em>, 21-24). Horace even goes so far in that poem as to
          associate sailing with other famous acts that defy the natural
          limitations of man, including Promethean thefts, Herculean journeys to
          the underworld, and precarious Daedalean flights (cf. <em>C.</em>
          1.3.27-36).<sup id="fnref:169"><a href="#fn:169" class="footnote">50</a></sup> From almost the very start, then, the sea in the
          <em>Odes</em> comes to represent a space beyond the limits imposed on all
          mortals.</p>
          
          <p>But the borders that Horace is working out in <em>C</em>. 1.3 are not just
          related to natural limitations of man; rather, as the famous addressee
          of the poem would suggest, these bounds of nature are also meant to
          represent the generic boundaries that are being crossed in that poem, as
          well as in several others of the collection.<sup id="fnref:170"><a href="#fn:170" class="footnote">51</a></sup> The poet in <em>C</em> 1.3
          is wishing his good friend Vergil a safe journey to Athens. That is what
          the poem claims on its surface, at least. It is hard, however, not to
          understant this <em>bon voyage</em> as having more to do with Vergil’s work on
          the epic <em>Aeneid</em> than a simple trans-Adriatic crossing.<sup id="fnref:171"><a href="#fn:171" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Indeed,
          as Michael Paschalis has put it, the “open sea space” in the <em>Odes</em>
          functions as “a metaphor or metonym…for non-lyric (‘grander’) genres
          and themes,” such as epic poetry.<sup id="fnref:172"><a href="#fn:172" class="footnote">53</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The generic implications of this trope likewise appear in several other
          poems in the first and second books of the <em>Odes</em>. In the famous Soracte
          Ode, for example, Horace advises his companion to “entrust everything
          else to the gods who have now calmed the warring winds on the seething
          surface of the sea” (<em>permitte divis cetera, qui simul / stravere ventos
          aequore fervido / deproeliantis</em>, <em>C</em>. 1.9.9-11) – the stormy sea having
          no place within the intimate lyric atmosphere of Horace’s private
          space.<sup id="fnref:173"><a href="#fn:173" class="footnote">54</a></sup> This idea is then made even more explicit in <em>C</em>. 1.14,
          where the fragile ship which Horace addresses has rightly been read as a
          representation of his poetry: it is a craft whose parts “creak”
          (<em>gemant</em>, <em>C</em>. 1.14.6) and lines are shred (cf. <em>non tibi sunt integra
          lineta</em>, 9), certainly no match for the harsh waters and “winds”
          (<em>ventis</em>, 15) of epic.<sup id="fnref:174"><a href="#fn:174" class="footnote">55</a></sup> One can similarly interpret <em>C</em>. 1.34 and
          the poet’s aborted sea journey into “epic” territory in that poem.<sup id="fnref:175"><a href="#fn:175" class="footnote">56</a></sup>
          In Book 2 itself, moreover, traditional lyric space is repeatedly carved
          out in contrast to those who wish to seek out the deep even when there
          are storms on the water (<em>C</em>. 2.10.1-3), or those who find themselves
          trapped in the wide open sea when rough weather has suddenly befallen
          them (<em>C.</em> 2.16.1-4).<sup id="fnref:176"><a href="#fn:176" class="footnote">57</a></sup> By the time a reader gets to <em>C</em>. 2.18,
          then, the act of entering the open sea is not only an established trope
          for crossing boundaries; it is a generically charged action, as well,
          when read in juxtaposition with several poems in Books 1 and 2 of the
          <em>Odes</em>.</p>
          
          <p>What then should a reader make of those who build villas that transgress
          the maritime boundaries of the natural world – who literally “drive back
          the shores of the sea” (<em>maris…</em> / <em>summovere litora</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.18.20-21)
          through their constructions? Such builders are clearly engaging in an
          ambitious undertaking that would seem rather out of tune with the
          traditional lyric space that Horace delineates for himself, that is, a
          space which seems completely opposed to the extension of boundaries,
          whether physical, natural, or generic, as I will suggest below in the
          figure of his Sabine farm. Bad as all this is, though, such architecture
          in <em>Odes</em> 2.18 not only transgresses the spatial bounds of “traditional”
          lyric, but the temporal ones, as well:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>tu secanda marmora
          locas sub ipsum funus et sepulcri
          immemor struis domos</p>
          
            <p>[…]</p>
          
            <p>Nulla certior tamen
          rapacis Orci fine destinata
          aula divitem manet
          erum. Quid ultra tendis? (<em>C</em>. 2.18.17-19, 29-32)</p>
          
            <p>At the very footstep of death you contract marble to be cut and
          unmindful of the tomb pile up houses. […] Nevertheless, when the
          territory of rapacious Death has been reached, no palace more surely
          awaits the rich master. Why do you strive further?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>While the rich go beyond the physical limits prescribed by man and
          nature in extending their homes across boundary stones and even into the
          sea, respectively, there is also the suggestion here that in doing so
          they no longer have any concern for death (cf. <em>sub ipsum funus
          sepulcri</em> / <em>immemor struis domos</em>, 18-19), especially in their apparent
          belief that what they build will protect them from its
          inevitability.<sup id="fnref:177"><a href="#fn:177" class="footnote">58</a></sup> According to Ellen Oliensis, in fact, the rich man
          in this passage is actually “seek[ing] to postpone the temporal
          <em>finis</em> of death by expanding the <em>fines</em> of his property.”<sup id="fnref:178"><a href="#fn:178" class="footnote">59</a></sup> Yet it
          does not matter what kind of building you erect for yourself; when you
          are dead, the poet warns, “no palace more surely awaits the rich master”
          (<em>nulla certior…</em> / <em>aula divitem manet</em> / <em>erum</em>, 29, 31-32).<sup id="fnref:179"><a href="#fn:179" class="footnote">60</a></sup> The
          greedy aristocrat has lost sight of the lyric “here and now” in his
          desire to extend his building activities further past all boundaries,
          temporal as well as spatial, and seek the sort of immortality more
          befitting an epic hero who will be kept alive in song. It seems that it
          is all for naught, though. All Horace can do is to ask such misguided
          men a version of a question that he asks in reprimanding his naughty
          Muse, namely, “why do you stive further” (<em>quid ultra tendis</em>,
          32).<sup id="fnref:180"><a href="#fn:180" class="footnote">61</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>In contrast to this excessive, seemingly unlimited drive of such
          architecture to transgress boundaries, both spatial and temporal, stands
          Horace’s own “unique Sabine holdings” (<em>unicis Sabinis</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.18.14).
          There is not much to say about Horace’s country abode, however, since
          the structure (rather conspicuously) bears no architectural description
          for a poem largely devoted to detailed accounts of architecture.<sup id="fnref:181"><a href="#fn:181" class="footnote">62</a></sup>
          It is almost as though the Sabine farm has left no imprint on nature at
          all. And that might be part of the point: Horace’s farm blends into the
          landscape, not extending further than it should, not overstepping the
          bounds of nature.<sup id="fnref:182"><a href="#fn:182" class="footnote">63</a></sup> The humble structure serves, according to Paul
          Allen Miller, as “the symbol of his acceptance of the limits of
          mortality on normal human existence,” as well as “a symbol of Horace’s
          poetry, of his satisfaction with his lot in life.”<sup id="fnref:183"><a href="#fn:183" class="footnote">64</a></sup> It is very
          different, in other words, from the transgressive structures that fill
          the rest of the poem and several of those in Book 2 – structures whose
          owners unlike Horace are never “happy enough” (<em>satis beatus</em>, <em>C</em>.
          2.18.14) with what they already have at the present moment.</p>
          
          <p>It might seem, then, that for Horace architecture which seeks to go
          beyond the boundaries of lyric space and time achieves nothing in the
          end – and certainly does not adhere to his traditional lyric principles
          of design.<sup id="fnref:184"><a href="#fn:184" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Such architecture is not just ostentatious; more
          importantly, it is <em>transgressive</em>, spatially as well as temporally. And
          the first poem of Book 3 elaborates further on this idea:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…somnus agrestium
          lenis virorum non humilis domos
          fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
          non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
          desiderantem quod satis est neque
          tumultuosum sollicitat mare</p>
          
            <p>[…]</p>
          
            <p>quodsi dolentem nec Phrygius lapis
          nec purpuratum sidere clarior
          delenit usus nec Falerna
          vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
          cur invidendis postibus et novo
          sublime ritu moliar atrium?
          cur valle permutem Sabina
          divitias operosiores (<em>C</em>. 3.1.21-26, 41-48)</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Gentle sleep does not despise the humble houses of rustic men and the
          shady riverbank, nor is the valley of Tempe disturbed by storm winds.
          The tumultuous sea does not bother the man desiring what is enough.
          […] But if Phrygian stone does not soothe a grieving man, nor
          wearing purple more brilliant than a star, nor Falernian wine or
          Persian perfume, why should I construct a lofty atrium in a new style,
          with doorposts that incite envy? Why should I exchange my Sabine
          valley for riches more full of worries?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The imagery here should be familiar by now to a reader of the <em>Odes</em>
          after all the warnings against the dangerous sea and luxurious
          architecture in the first two books. The tumultuous sea (<em>tumultuosum…
          mare</em>, 26) is of no concern to simple, “rustic” (<em>agrestium</em>, 21) men
          like Horace who inhabit “humble homes” (<em>humilis domos</em>, 22), only
          “desiring what is enough” (<em>desiderantem quod satis est</em>, 25).<sup id="fnref:185"><a href="#fn:185" class="footnote">66</a></sup>
          After all, a grieving man cannot be helped by what such exploration can
          bring back, whether it be wealth, or the marble columns, purple dye,
          wine, and perfume that accompany it (41-45). What is the point, the poet
          therefore asks, of building a grand structure in a new style
          (<em>novo…ritu</em>, 45-46) – one that is designed with doorposts that will
          just incite envy (<em>invidendis postibus</em>, 45) and a lofty hall
          (<em>sublime…atrium</em>, 46) whose very height could only serve to cause one
          concern?<sup id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186" class="footnote">67</a></sup> In contrast to all this “modern” architecture once again
          stands Horace’s own lowly farm, or rather – in a way that calls even
          less attention to its actual physical structure – his “Sabine valley”
          (<em>valle…Sabina</em>, <em>C.</em> 3.1.47).<sup id="fnref:187"><a href="#fn:187" class="footnote">68</a></sup> According to the poet, at least,
          that is all he needs to be content.</p>
          
          <p>Is he actually content, though? Horace spends quite a bit of time, as we
          have seen, describing the excessiveness of villa architecture in the
          <em>Odes</em> – so much time, in fact, that Eleanor Leach has seen some of
          these poems as “virtually a celebration of luxury.”<sup id="fnref:188"><a href="#fn:188" class="footnote">69</a></sup> If Horace has
          such great contempt for these structures, why then does he devote so
          many poems and lines to describing them and relatively so little to the
          description of his own modest farm? I will return to that question
          momentarily. It is important, though, to understand that – as with the
          architectural rants in Book 2 – personal luxury here is not the only, or
          even most important, referent.<sup id="fnref:189"><a href="#fn:189" class="footnote">70</a></sup> There is a sense that the excessive
          villa and the humble farm combine to form a kind of generic discourse;
          they are architextural, in other words, to use the terminology put
          forward in this dissertation.<sup id="fnref:190"><a href="#fn:190" class="footnote">71</a></sup> Nor has the metapoetic nature of
          these structures escaped scholars of the <em>Odes</em>. Riemer Faber has
          correctly suggested, for instance, that “[j]ust as the Sabine estate
          represents a lifestyle and literary aesthetic that contrasts with
          greater wealth associated with a more ambitious form of poetry, so too
          the preceding clause, in 3.1.45-46, may be read as literary
          discourse.”<sup id="fnref:191"><a href="#fn:191" class="footnote">72</a></sup> According to Faber’s argument, <em>C.</em> 3.1 in particular
          is about the pressures of joining “private, non-political life and
          personal poetry to public, national, and political poetry.” It is not
          that Horace is unable to do so, Faber claims, but rather that he is
          “express[ing] the difficulty he has in uniting them.”<sup id="fnref:192"><a href="#fn:192" class="footnote">73</a></sup> Horace
          cannot escape the public spotlight, the argument runs, and its trappings
          of wealth and grandeur cannot but find their way into his private lyric.</p>
          
          <p>Even if one were to forgive the biographical fallacy to which this view
          runs dangerously close, Faber’s conclusion nevertheless does not seem to
          give Horace enough credit, especially if one considers more closely the
          nuanced rhetorical stance that the poet is taking in these odes on
          architecture. The constant attention to transgressive architecture does
          not necessarily mean that Horace is having “difficulty” fitting it
          together with his traditional lyric mode as represented by his modest
          farm. The previous section introduced the idea of the inverted
          <em>recusatio</em> in the <em>Odes</em> for poems in which Horace reprimands his Muse
          for transgressing the limits of his lyric. This allowed the poet, I
          argued, to integrate extrageneric material from epic into his poem while
          actively disavowing it. A similar interpretation can be applied to his
          architextural images of excess and their owners in the poems examined in
          this section: it is not that the poet has trouble incorporating the
          grand, public, political mode into his humble, private, personal lyric;
          rather, on the contrary, he is able to do just that <em>through</em> claiming
          to renounce the former.</p>
          
          <p>For this technique to be effective, however, it requires a delicate
          balancing of the two sides. It is no wonder, then, that Horace spends so
          many lines on villas that try to extend beyond boundaries of traditional
          lyric space and time, of the lyric “here and now,” in contrast to so few
          on his own farm. Horace can easily establish his “traditional” lyric
          space and time through the mere mention of his Sabine farm; the space
          automatically has the poet’s stamp of approval because it is Horace’s,
          after all, and Horace is a lyric poet. The Sabine farm does not need
          much therefore to authorize it as a symbolic architextural structure for
          Horace’s lyric. To introduce the opposing extrageneric material is a
          different matter: the poet needs to give more attention to that which he
          claims to disavow – as is common in the “inverted” <em>recusatio</em> trope –
          so that it too can be become established in his poetry, even while
          Horace appears to reject it as another’s prerogative. Too much
          description of his farm would throw this tension out of balance. Too
          little about the transgressive villas, on the other hand, and the reader
          might miss the point – just as too much discussion of them would make
          Horace seem insincere in his rejection of them. The balance has to be
          just right, in other words, for the tensions to be weighed appropriately
          so that the boundary of “traditional” lyric space and time that
          separates the two can remain stable.</p>
          
          <p>Michèle Lowrie interprets Horace’s apparent “crossing [of] the limits
          he has established” as “serv[ing] a definitional purpose” for his
          poetics. While that interpretation is not incorrect, I do not agree with
          Lowrie’s conclusion that the poet is “mov[ing] from an initial
          limiting gesture, to an expansive one, back to a compromise between the
          two.”<sup id="fnref:193"><a href="#fn:193" class="footnote">74</a></sup> Horace is not entirely disingenuous in his injunctions
          against such transgressive structures. The function of the inverted
          <em>recusatio</em> is to make it possible, I would argue, for Horace to avoid
          choosing either the lyric farm or the “epic” architecture of
          contemporary villas – or even to have to make a “compromise” between the
          two, as Lowrie suggests it. That does not mean Horace is employing the
          inverted <em>recusatio</em> trope here because he is non-committal, or because
          he wants to “eat his cake and have it too,” as Commager remarked.<sup id="fnref:194"><a href="#fn:194" class="footnote">75</a></sup>
          Maintaining this tension is in fact essential to Horace’s redefinition
          of traditional lyric space and time: it serves to <em>reinforce</em> the
          stability of traditional lyric boundaries, even as they are redefined,
          in such a way that Horace can revitalize the structure without
          destabilizing its foundations.</p>
          
          <p>To undertand this complicated dynamic it might be helpful to turn to the
          theories of the 20^th^-century Russian semiotician Juri Lotman. In his
          <em>The Structure of the Artistic Text</em>, for example, Lotman argues that
          the “violation” of a structure can often catalyze the “informational
          activization” of that very same structure. In the case of an “artistic
          text,” in fact, the text</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>does not merely represent the implementation of structural norms, but
          their violation as well. It functions in a dual structural field
          consisting of the tendency to establish order and to violate it.
          Although each tendency tries to dominate and destroy the opposing one,
          the victory of either would prove fatal to art. <em>The life of an
          artistic text depends on their mutual tension</em>.<sup id="fnref:195"><a href="#fn:195" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The inclusion of extrageneric time and space through an inverted
          <em>recusatio</em> does not destabilize the generic boundaries of “traditional”
          lyric that are established through Horace’s Sabine farm; rather, as
          Lotman suggests, the tension created helps to activate, or revitalize,
          the traditional structure of Horatian lyric – and, more importantly, to
          keep it “alive” and dynamic. The poet’s statements about his farm gain
          meaning and definition, in other words, from the contrast between it and
          the transgressive nature of the other architextural images in the
          <em>Odes</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>. The tension that is thus produced by the
          rhetorical figure of the inverted <em>recusatio</em> is not deleterious to the
          traditional boundaries of lyric but instead allows both sides of the
          spectrum to exist within Horace’s lyric structure – in tension, yes, but
          equally balanced in such a way as to keep the boundary between the two
          sides stable.</p>
          
          <p>The tension discussed in this section between the two architextural
          extremes is therefore integral to <em>stabilizing</em> the structure of
          “traditional” lyric even while adding what might seem to be hostile to
          it. This notion of balanced tensions leading to stability and new life
          can also help account for the tensions that exist in Horace’s most
          famous architextural image: his <em>monumentum</em> that concludes his first
          collection of <em>Odes</em>. It is in fact the tension within his poetry as
          brought out by the contrast between Horace’s farm and transgressive
          architecture analyzed in this section that enables Horace to create a
          structure that is stable enough to overcome death and yet dynamic enough
          to always be “fresh” (<em>recens</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.8).</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-3-exegi-monumentum">Part 3. <em>Exegi Monumentum</em>…</h3>
          
          <p>In <em>C</em>. 2.10, the very ode in which Horace famously introduces the idea
          of the “golden mean” (<em>aurea mediocritas</em>, 5), the poet claims that
          “high towers fall with a greater crash” (<em>celsae graviore casu</em> /
          <em>decidunt turres</em>, 10-11). By so far as architecture departs from the
          natural bounds of space and time, the poet seems to be saying, to that
          degree it will tumble into ruin. Where does that leave Horace’s own
          rather impressive monument that he imagines in <em>C</em>. 3.30? How does
          <em>that</em> fit into this picture when it seems to contradict so blatantly
          the kind of traditional lyric space and time symbolized by Horace’s farm
          when contrasted to the transgressive villas discussed in the previous
          section?<sup id="fnref:196"><a href="#fn:196" class="footnote">77</a></sup> Indeed, Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> seems to transgress the
          very boundaries of his traditional lyric structure in an even more
          extreme manner than any structure which he criticizes previously in the
          <em>Odes</em>, as the beginning of the poem demonstrates:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Exegi monumentum aere perennius
          regalique situ pyramidum altius,
          quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens
          possit diruere aut innumerabilis
          annorum series et fuga temporum.
          non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei
          vitabit Libitinam: usque ego postera
          crescam laude recens… (<em>C</em>. 3.30.1-8)</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>I have completed a monument more lasting than bronze and loftier than
          the royal structure of the pyramids, which neither the decaying rain
          nor the powerless north wind could up-root – or even the innumerable
          series of years and flight of ages. I will not die entirely, and a
          great part of me will avoid death: constantly I fresh will grow by
          posterity’s praise…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This poem has been interpreted in a number of ways to account for the
          apparent contradiction between such a monument that completely
          transgresses the laws of nature and the earlier injunctions against the
          kind of architecture in Books 2 and 3 that does just that. Neville
          Collinge tries to solve the tension by considering that the poem is
          simply “diffident in tone” and not entirely serious.<sup id="fnref:197"><a href="#fn:197" class="footnote">78</a></sup> Don Fowler
          suggests, on the other hand, that the lack of “restraint” in the finale
          to the <em>Odes</em> is representative of a hidden “guilty will to power” on
          the part of Horace – that the poet simply could not help but make such
          grand claims living in the regime that he does.<sup id="fnref:198"><a href="#fn:198" class="footnote">79</a></sup> Matthew Santirocco
          represents perhaps a middle position between these two approaches,
          arguing that while the poem might be “a bit self-deprecatory” the
          “pride” which Horace feels is genuine; in fact, according to Santirocco,
          the poem reveals a desire on the part of the poet to establish himself
          in such a way that he would become “to poetry what Augustus is to the
          state.”<sup id="fnref:199"><a href="#fn:199" class="footnote">80</a></sup></p>

          <p>I will explore the implications of this parallel between Augustus and
          Horace in the final section of this chapter. It is first necessary,
          though, to show how the architextural <em>monumentum</em> here is perhaps the
          perfect symbol for the kind of lyric that the poet has constructed in
          his <em>Odes</em>. Although it is transgressive to the highest degree, the
          <em>monumentum</em> is built just like the traditional lyric structure that
          Horace constructs, that is, through a balancing of tensions in such a
          way that the monument too can be more stable than anything ever built
          and yet eternally dynamic at the same time.<sup id="fnref:200"><a href="#fn:200" class="footnote">81</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The first five lines of the poem present the <em>monumentum</em> as a structure
          that clearly transgresses both temporal and spatial boundaries of
          Horace’s lyric here and now.<sup id="fnref:201"><a href="#fn:201" class="footnote">82</a></sup> From a temporal standpoint the
          monument will survive longer than the longest-lasting metal that
          humankind can work.<sup id="fnref:202"><a href="#fn:202" class="footnote">83</a></sup> Nor will it be affected by the physical limits
          of nature as represented by the “decaying rain” (<em>imber edax</em>, 3) and
          the now “powerless” wind (<em>impotens</em>, 3); even more impressively, it
          will exist outside of the eternal cycling of seasons (cf.
          <em>innumerabilis</em> / <em>annorum series et fuga temporum</em>, 4-5).<sup id="fnref:203"><a href="#fn:203" class="footnote">84</a></sup> In
          terms of spatial excess, moreover, Horace’s monument will be “loftier
          than the regal structure of the pyramids” (<em>regalique situ pyramidum
          altius</em>, 2).<sup id="fnref:204"><a href="#fn:204" class="footnote">85</a></sup> All this suggests that the <em>monumentum</em> of the poet
          would be perhaps the most stable structure ever constructed in its
          ability to resist those forces – gravity and time – that ultimately
          destroy all works crafted by humankind.</p>
          
          <p>Yet the monument is at the same time shown to be dynamic. It might well
          seem odd at first that Horace says he will “grow” (<em>crescam</em>, 8) from
          the praises of posterity. As scholars have suggested, however, the
          imagery here is not inappropriate since the poet and his lyric
          <em>monumentum</em> have “imperceptibly” become one and the same by this point
          in the poem.<sup id="fnref:205"><a href="#fn:205" class="footnote">86</a></sup> But then the question becomes: “How can a stable
          monument grow?” This is an issue that has spurred some interesting and
          highly subtle interpretations. Whereas Michael C. J. Putnam argues that
          “growth retaining continued freshness, eternity imposed on futurity…only
          certifies the initial programme of a <em>monumentum</em> espousing stature
          beyond space and time,”<sup id="fnref:206"><a href="#fn:206" class="footnote">87</a></sup> Michèle Lowrie suggests that “image of a
          breathing monument” is able to avoid “the stasis of formalism” because a
          “<em>monumentum</em> (monument, reminder, tomb, literary corpus) is not only a
          piece of architecture, but a speech act.”<sup id="fnref:207"><a href="#fn:207" class="footnote">88</a></sup> It would seem, however,
          that these scholars are overlooking the straightforward way in which
          Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> is figured in an explicitly physical sense: it has
          materiality (<em>aere perennius</em>, 1); it has physical dimensions
          (<em>regalique situ pyramidum altius</em>, 2).<sup id="fnref:208"><a href="#fn:208" class="footnote">89</a></sup> The poet is employing the
          idea of the monument here, I would argue, because monuments offer a
          tangible feeling of stability that gives their viewers a sense of surety
          against the forces which affect all mortals. The notion that this
          <em>monumentum</em> can overcome those forces does not make it less physical;
          if anything, in fact, Horace’s structure is a monument, <em>par
          excellence</em>, in its ability to endure past all bounds. If this is the
          case, though, then there would certainly seem to be a real tension here
          between the stability that Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> as a monument promises
          and his prophecy that it will be eternally dynamic.<sup id="fnref:209"><a href="#fn:209" class="footnote">90</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>That very tension is the point, however. It makes sense for Horace’s
          architextural monument to be both stable and dynamic,<sup id="fnref:210"><a href="#fn:210" class="footnote">91</a></sup> for it
          represents a poetics that is itself based on tensions that allow the
          poet to stabilize traditional lyric space while he redefines it. I have
          argued in this chapter that Horace “inverts” the <em>recusatio</em> in order to
          construct his generic boundaries so that he can incorporate generic
          tensions into its very structure without causing it to crack at the
          foundations, that is, to create a stable lyric structure that can remain
          traditional while still being innovative. That might seem paradoxical –
          just as a monument that is stable and yet grows also might appear
          paradoxical. This is not paradox for the sake of paradox, though, or
          some kind of deconstructive dark humor for that matter. It is precisely
          <em>because of</em> the incorporation of these mutual tensions through the
          poem’s opposed architextural images that I have suggested Horace’s
          poetry can achieve a dynamic enough nature to be <em>simultaneously</em> old
          and new, traditional and innovative.<sup id="fnref:211"><a href="#fn:211" class="footnote">92</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The use of such tensions can be found outside of Horace’s <em>Odes</em>, as
          well. The remaining part of this chapter will suggest that understanding
          how Horace constructs his <em>monumentum</em> can also inform one’s reading of
          the tensions within the rhetoric of monumentality in the Augustan age
          more broadly.<sup id="fnref:212"><a href="#fn:212" class="footnote">93</a></sup> It is because Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> does not
          represent a compromise but rather a delicate balancing of tensions that
          makes Horace’s <em>Odes</em> into a true Augustan monument, that is, one which
          is stable <em>and</em> dynamic,<sup id="fnref:213"><a href="#fn:213" class="footnote">94</a></sup> one which able to signify past tradition
          and present innovation at the same time.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-4-horaces-augustan-monument">Part 4. Horace’s Augustan Monument</h3>
          
          <p>In her book on <em>Horace and the Rhetoric of Authority</em>, Ellen Oliensis
          argues that the poet’s lyric poetry</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>with its multiple articulations and recurrent arrests, tends to
          concentrate…on <em>fines.</em> […] And <em>yet</em> it is just this emphasis
          on limit that lends Horatian lyric an “imperial” character. The
          peculiar energy that charges Horace’s lyric <em>fines</em> both derives from
          and feeds a larger cultural preoccupation with the masterful
          articulation of space.<sup id="fnref:214"><a href="#fn:214" class="footnote">95</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This “cultural preoccupation” is of course a reference to what Augustus
          himself was doing to the structure of Rome – the physical one as well as
          the one in the Roman imagination. The <em>princeps</em> was pushing the borders
          of the empire farther than ever before. If Rome keeps growing and
          incorporating more and more land and peoples, though, how can Roman
          identity remain stable? That is an important question, no doubt, and one
          that may have entered the minds of those living under Augustus amidst so
          much change. Yet the physical borders of the empire were not the only
          ones that were being redefined. At the same time, and more pertinent to
          the focus of this dissertation, Augustus was redefining the structure of
          the <em>res publica</em>, too, and incorporating into it ingredients and roles
          that were very different from those of the Roman state during its rise
          to power. Could Rome still remain “Rome” in the midst of so much
          redefinition of its boundaries, outwards as well as from within its
          <em>fines</em>?</p>
          
          <p>Chapter II demonstrated just how important architecture was to the
          Romans’ conception of the world around them and, in particular, to the
          way that they saw their state. Yet the old structure of Rome was simply
          that, old, and it had fallen into ruin – at least, according to Horace
          himself, when he laments that Rome’s own architectural structures had
          fallen into disrepair during the civil wars, and with them so had the
          Roman state and its <em>mores</em>.<sup id="fnref:215"><a href="#fn:215" class="footnote">96</a></sup> Coming to this particular situation
          Augustus needed to rebuild Rome, the idea of it as much as its physical
          appearance. For this monumentalization of the city to be successful,
          however, it had to be connected to the foundations of Rome’s past.
          Augustus could not simply disregard the old structure of the republic,
          in other words, even as he built his new one in the form of the
          principate.</p>
          
          <p>This chapter has teased out some of the nuances of Horace’s rhetorical
          strategies in his attempt to redefine “traditional” lyric dimensions
          through a balancing of tensions. It is interesting (and perhaps even
          illuminating) to see what this approach can tell us about the careful
          words that the <em>princeps</em> used to articulate his own revitalization of
          traditional Roman “structures” in the <em>Res Gestae</em> through a similar
          balancing of tensions. The Augustan program needed to be traditional and
          yet new, republican and yet imperial. The <em>princeps</em> protests, too, in
          favor of the traditional structures upon which Rome had been founded. At
          the same time – and just like Horace – by keeping old and new systems in
          subtle tension with each other he simultaneously integrates into these
          structures a novel system of power without outwardly appearing to
          destabilize the old foundations; if anything, in fact, it allows the
          <em>princeps</em> to revitalize them, even as he introduces dramatic changes to
          the republican structure.<sup id="fnref:216"><a href="#fn:216" class="footnote">97</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>There are numerous sections in the monumental inscription of the <em>Res
          Gestae</em> where a reader can find Augustus refusing to accept novel honors
          and titles. In <em>RGDA</em> 6, for example, Augustus claims that he “did not
          receive any magistracy offered against the custom of his ancestors,”
          even though it was what he claims the senate and Roman people wanted for
          him.<sup id="fnref:217"><a href="#fn:217" class="footnote">98</a></sup> This comes at the end of a long list of “<em>res non gestae</em>”
          which – according to Walter Eder – “serve[s] only to profile the
          <em>princeps</em> as the incorruptible guardian of tradition who took care,
          even against the will of Senate and People, not to contradict the
          constitution of the fathers.”<sup id="fnref:218"><a href="#fn:218" class="footnote">99</a></sup> That seems to be correct, at least
          on the surface. But it would also seem that if Augustus constantly goes
          against the will of the Senate and People he is making just as much of a
          statement about his power and its innovative nature. He neither needs
          nor desires honors such as the consulship (or worse the dictatorship)
          that represented the height of the republican <em>cursus honorum</em>.<sup id="fnref:219"><a href="#fn:219" class="footnote">100</a></sup>
          And so he can “refuse” receiving them in an untraditional way. As Horace
          with his ambitious builders transgressing the boundaries of his
          traditional lyric time and space, so too Augustus with his subjects
          offering to him what they should not. The transgression appears to be
          all theirs, not his. By employing the rhetoric of the inverted
          <em>recusatio</em> here – by being the active refuser of something seemingly
          untraditional – the <em>princeps</em> is able to show his respect for past
          traditions while simultaneously communicating that his new system no
          longer requires them.</p>
          
          <p>Refusing honors in this way was not the only manner in which Augustus
          was successful in carefully articulating the transformation of Rome from
          the old republic to the new principate through the use of an inverted
          <em>recusatio</em>. The more significant examples for the purposes of this
          chapter concern what Augustus has to say in his <em>Res Gestae</em> about his
          own building program. The <em>princeps</em> lists several of his architectural
          efforts in Chapters 19, 20, and 21,<sup id="fnref:220"><a href="#fn:220" class="footnote">101</a></sup> which is provided in its

            <p><strong>19.</strong> I built the curia and the chalcidicum next to it and the
          temple of Apollo on the Palatine with its porticoes, the temple of the
          divine Julius, the Lupercal, the portico near the Circus Flaminius,
          which I allowed to be called Octavian from the name of him who had
          first built it in that same place, the Pulvinar at the Circus Maximus,
          the temples on the Capitoline of Jupiter Feretrius and of Jupiter
          Tonans, the temple of Quirinus, the temples of Minerva and of Queen
          Juno and of Jupiter on the Aventine, the temple of the Lares on the
          top of the Sacred Way, the temple of the Penates gods on the Velia,
          the temple of Youth, and the temple of the Great Mother on the
          Palatine.</p>
          
            <p><strong>20.</strong> I renovated the Capitolium and the Theatre of Pompey – each
          work at a great cost – without any inscription of my name. I renovated
          the aqueducts in several places where they were falling apart because
          of old age and I doubled the aqueduct which is called the Marcian by
          letting a new spring into its stream. I finished the Forum Julium and
          the basilica which was between the temple of Castor and the temple of
          Saturn – works having been begun and advanced far by my father – and I
          began under the title of the name of my sons work on the same basilica
          which had been destroyed by a fire, with the base of it having been
          increased in size, and I ordered it to be finished by my heirs if I
          did not finish it while I was alive. I renovated 82 temples of the
          gods in the city as consul for the sixth time on the authority of the
          senate – with not one having been passed over which needed to be
          renovated at the time. As consul for a seventh time I renovated the
          Via Flaminia from the city to Arminium, as well as all the bridges
          except the Mulvian and Minucian.</p>
          
            <p><strong>21.</strong> On private ground I built the temple of Mars Ultor and the
          Forum Augustum from my plunder. I built a theatre near the temple of
          Apollo on ground for the most part having been bought from private
          citizens, which would be in the name of my son-in-law, Marcellus. I
          consecrated gifts from public spoils on the Capitolium, on the temple
          of divine Julius,on the temple of Vesta, and on the temple of Mars
          Ultor, which cost me around 100 million sesterces. When I was consul
          for a fifth time I sent back 35,000 pounds of crown-gold although the
          municipalities and colonies of Italy were offering it for my triumphs,
          and afterwards, each single time I was called imperator, I did not
          accept crown-gold, even though the municipalities and colonies were
          decreeing it as kindly as they had decreed it previously.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I have cited the whole list here to demonstrate that while it might be
          impressive in length and content the style in which Augustus talks about
          his buildings is rather understated. For all the structures he claims to
          have built (<em>feci</em>), rebuilt (<em>refeci</em>), or completed (<em>perfeci</em>), there
          is almost no description of them – of their height, of their material,
          or of really anything specific about their quality. He does mention
          their costs a few times, but their physical nature as buildings is
          dramatically underplayed. There is certainly nothing too explicit in his
          language about how their impressive quality has increased the <em>maiestas</em>
          of Rome, as Vitruvius claims in the preface to his <em>De architectura</em>
          analyzed above in Chapter II.<sup id="fnref:221"><a href="#fn:221" class="footnote">102</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This passage is certainly in keeping with the at times rather
          undescriptive language of many an inscription.<sup id="fnref:222"><a href="#fn:222" class="footnote">103</a></sup> And anyone reading
          in Rome, at least, would of course have the physical buildings
          themselves at which to marvel.<sup id="fnref:223"><a href="#fn:223" class="footnote">104</a></sup> However, the way that Augustus
          simply lists, without much detail at all, the structures that
          contributed to the incredible transformation which he has brought about
          to the city of Rome seems almost <em>too</em> modest, especially when compared
          to Augustus’ own famous boast recorded by Suetonius to have left Rome a
          city of marble,<sup id="fnref:224"><a href="#fn:224" class="footnote">105</a></sup> or Strabo’s over-the-top praise of the Campus
          Martius in Book 3 of his <em>Geography</em>,<sup id="fnref:225"><a href="#fn:225" class="footnote">106</a></sup> or even Vergil’s allusions
          to the golden-roofed Capitoline temple in Book 8 of the <em>Aeneid</em>.<sup id="fnref:226"><a href="#fn:226" class="footnote">107</a></sup>
          Augustus does mention amounts of gold and other materials elsewhere in
          the inscription. At the end of Chapter 21 (cited above), for example, he
          speaks of the donation of 100 million sesterces that he made, as well as
          the 35,000 pounds of “crown-gold” that he “refused” to take from the
          Italian colonies. Perhaps it should not be surprising, though, that
          Augustus picks the end of his architectural deeds to insert these many
          “refusals” to accept all the crown-gold offered to him: in the language
          of the <em>Res Gestae</em> neither “heads” of Rome – that is, the Capitoline or
          Augustus’ – are to be depicted with their respective golden crowns. To
          depict them as such would be out of line with tradition.<sup id="fnref:227"><a href="#fn:227" class="footnote">108</a></sup> To show
          restraint in his words and actions grants the <em>princeps</em>, on the other
          hand, the opportunity to allude to the image of these novelties within
          <em>Res Gestae</em> even while seeming to downplay or reject them. Augustus can
          thus create a subtle tension in his <em>Res Gestae</em> that helps him to
          articulate his new powers through the actions of others without going
          outside the traditions of the past himself.</p>
          
          <p>Augustus achieves this tension in other ways, as well, through his
          building program itself. He does not merely build under his own name,
          for instance, but often does so under that of another. In the most
          telling example of this non-naming Augustus claims to have “renovated”
          the Theatre of Pompey “without any inscription of my [i.e., Augustus’]
          name” (<em>refeci sine ulla inscriptione nominis mei</em>, <em>RGDA</em> 20) – a
          statement which receives additional emphasis from its placement after
          the verb <em>refeci</em>.<sup id="fnref:228"><a href="#fn:228" class="footnote">109</a></sup> It is not restraint that compels Augustus to
          behave in this manner. This “refusal” instead demonstrates that Augustus
          does not need to use the republican tradition of inscribing buildings
          with one’s name if he so chooses. Why? Because his power goes beyond
          simple republican display. Inscribing every building with one’s own name
          – that was part of Pompey’s and Caesar’s strategy, just as it was for
          many a Roman aristocrat before them. It can be assumed that every Roman
          knew exactly who was responsible for these buildings whether the name of
          the <em>princeps</em> was there or not. Augustus stresses in this passage that
          he has kept the physical structures of the past intact in his
          reconstruction of the city; he goes out of his way, in fact, to
          emphasize that he has repaired all the temples in Rome that needed it
          (cf. <em>nullo praetermisso quod e</em>[<em>o</em>] <em>tempore</em> [<em>refici
          debeba</em>]<em>t</em>, <em>RGDA</em> 20). By discussing this reconstruction as he does
          in his <em>Res Gestae</em>, however, the <em>princeps</em> can show how these
          structures take on new meaning under the principate, even if – or rather
          <em>because</em> – he “refuses” to change their form, or add his name in place
          of the original builder.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>princeps</em> built more than anyone else has. That much is clear from
          the lengthy passage cited above.<sup id="fnref:229"><a href="#fn:229" class="footnote">110</a></sup> His description does not stress
          that he is building <em>differently</em> from his predecessors, however. And
          the particular strategy of “refusal” that he employs here – whereby he
          actively denies to himself the power or recognition that he has already
          gained – should be familiar now from the above examination of Horace’s
          <em>Odes</em> in this chapter. Indeed, as with the poet’s lyric, the genius of
          Augustus’ redefinition of Rome was that his refusals to change it
          actually allowed him to articulate that he had. The monumentalization of
          Rome as described in the <em>Res Gestae</em> is conveyed not through blatant
          statements of transformation, but rather in the implications that lie
          behind, and are almost contradictory to, what his words claim in the
          inscription. And like the poet Augustus used this tension to respect the
          past – to redefine and revitalize Roman traditions – while
          simultaneously constructing something new.</p>
          
          <p>By thus reconstructing the traditional borders of Rome’s structure,
          physically as well as metaphorically, the <em>princeps</em> could stabilize
          what it meant to be a good traditional Roman while in some ways
          dramatically departing from what it had meant in the republic. This is
          only possible, however, because he has injected his architectural
          discourse with a stabilizing tension between the new and the
          traditional. Augustus does not have choose between what was conventional
          and what was not: he can have both <em>simultaneously</em> by delicately
          balancing them in tension with each other. The Augustan age was not just
          a period in which Rome’s traditional structures were redefined; just as
          important, it was also an age of redefining <em>how</em> one can define such
          structures in the first place.</p>
          
          <p>This chapter has demonstrated why the lyric <em>monumentum</em> in finale of
          the <em>Odes</em> is perhaps the perfect architextural structure for
          representing his first collection of lyric poetry. Horace builds up the
          tensions on which it is based from the start – transgressive structure
          by transgressive structure, inverted <em>recusatio</em> by inverted
          <em>recusatio</em>. The tensions that emerge in contrasting his Sabine farm to
          these transgressive structures allowed him <em>both</em> to establish a
          “traditional” structure for his lyric <em>and</em> to bring novel material
          inside of it. This rhetorical strategy should not be seen as deceitful
          in some way: from the start Horace has been proclaiming – albeit through
          “refusing” – his poetry’s innovative, dynamic nature from within its
          “traditional” lyric bounds.</p>
          
          <p>How does understanding the way that Horace builds his “monument” give us
          insight into the architectural discourse of the monumentalization of
          Augustan Rome? It might be tempting at first to suggest that in <em>C</em>.
          3.30 Horace is in some way “exposing” and thereby subtly criticizing the
          “delicate” nature of Augustus’ rhetorical strategy.<sup id="fnref:230"><a href="#fn:230" class="footnote">111</a></sup> But that
          interpretation would suggest that the parallel is entirely intentional –
          and, more importantly, quite limited in its aims. We can never know for
          certain how conscious Horace was of the parallel, let alone whether he
          meant it negatively.<sup id="fnref:231"><a href="#fn:231" class="footnote">112</a></sup> In his book on Augustan culture Karl Galinsky
          has suggested a more nuanced way of understanding the sense of a “shared
          direction” between the poet and the <em>princeps</em>:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>It would be futile to fall back on the schematic explanation that one
          man “influenced” the other or, worse yet, to relapse into the
          hierarchical model according to which Horace takes orders from
          Octavian. Rather, what we see here at an early stage, long before
          Augustus’ expanding <em>auctoritas,</em> is a sense of shared direction. Its
          elaboration is left to the inclination and creativity of the
          individuals. This accounts for another characteristic that the
          implementations of both Horace and Augustus have in common: neither is
          content with simply replicating… Rather, both turn their creative
          energies to surpassing the model and giving it a meaning of their own.
          It is a process that is profoundly characteristic of Augustan culture.
          […] Horace, instead of being a mere imperial versifier, carries on a
          creative dialogue with the Augustan milieu. He reacts to some of its
          ideas and reshapes them in his own way. Above all, he is never
          passive.<sup id="fnref:232"><a href="#fn:232" class="footnote">113</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>One does not have to accept Galinsky’s seemingly all-encompassing idea
          of <em>auctoritas</em> for his approach here to have validity. What we can
          reasonably say given the findings of this chapter is that Horace’s
          <em>Odes</em> taps into the rhetorical strategies of the Augustan age in which
          a “refusal” to condone modifications to a traditional structures
          actually granted existence to those same innovations as part of the
          structure itself – innovations which in turn revitalized the structure.</p>
          
          <p>Horace did not write an epic for the <em>princeps</em>. Nor did he need to. His
          lyric <em>monumentum</em> is an especially fitting contribution to Augustus’
          monumentalization of Rome: it represents for us the kind of claim
          through architectural imagery that Augustus could not make explicitly
          because to make it would in a sense disrupt the perfect balance of
          republic and imperial power that the “refusals” themselves had already
          allowed the <em>princeps</em> to assume. The poet could decide without too much
          anxiety to build his immortalizing monument while alive. He had little
          to fear (besides perhaps ridicule) by proclaiming his own poetic
          “apotheosis” at the end of the first publication of his <em>Odes</em>. For
          obvious reasons such was not the case for the <em>princeps</em>, who smartly
          waited until after he died to let himself be deified in Rome. The point
          is that Augustus did not have to say he would become immortal for it to
          happen. And we can imagine that even without <em>C</em>. 3.30 much the same
          could be said about Horace and his forever stable yet eternally dynamic
          lyric <em>monumentum</em>.</p>

                <p>My argument again is not so much interested in how Horace is
          engaging with the monuments of the Augustan age as it is in how he
          plays a part in creating the discourse surrounding monuments in
          general. For Horace’ interaction – or rather lack thereof – with
          actual Augustan monuments see Hardie 1993, 126, claiming that
          “[o]ne reason for Horace’s reluctance to evoke actual monuments in
          his verse is the desire to establish his own words as an
          alternative, and superior, kind of monument,” and Jaeger 1995, 191,
          where she argues that “[b]y circumventing the buildings to focus
          attention on the ephemeral and the permanent [in <em>C</em>. 1.8],
          [Horace] has celebrated the place while maintaining his own
          standards for his chosen genre.” Despite the lack of Roman monuments
          in Horace’s poems I find Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 26, to be right
          in suggesting that “Horace is the first poet who shows clear signs
          of being deeply affected by…changes in the experiential fabric of
          Rome,” especially given all the attention he bestows upon
          architecture throughout the <em>Odes</em>. <a href="#fnref:139" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          violent erotic passion, as well, and thus a location suitable for
          more elegiac themes. In <em>C</em>. 1.5, for instance, the poet compares

          so that, soaked and buffeted by the waves of her perfidy, they at
          last retire from the life of love…” This interpretation has led
          some scholars – mistaking elegiac space for actual erotic
          circumstance – to see the ship in <em>C</em>. 1.14 as an allegory for a
          woman whom Horace is trying to dissuade from embarking on another
          amatory (mis)adventure. See Anderson 1966, Woodman 1980, and Knorr
          2006 in favor of this argument and Jocelyn 1982 for a critique of
          it. Murgatroyd 1995 provides a detailed survey of the “sea of love”
          trope in both Greek and Latin poetry. <a href="#fnref:172" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>Anderson 1966 was to first to consider seriously that Horace
          here might be referring to “poem-ship” – though he rejects this idea
          in the end because of “the simple fact that Horace separates himself
          from his ‘ship,’ whereas the poet and ship conventionally belonged
          together” (91). Zumwalt 1978-1979 builds upon this point and argues
          that the poet transfigures the allegory as the “Ship of Love Poetry”
          – a symbol for Horace’s “creative faculty as love or ‘light’
          lyricist” (250). It is lyric in general, however, and not lyric as

          is destabilized by his repeated descriptions of them within his
          verse… For all the rants against ambitious building projects,

          2000, 198, putting a more deconstructive spin on the dynamic nature
          of Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> by asking us to consider that “[t]his is
          metaphorical marble, not real marble. But if real monuments decay,
          can we be so sure of metaphorical ones? Beneath the surface polish
          lurks the beginnings of decay, the potential for letters and sense
          to fall off the stone, the inner instability which in Horatian
          diagnostics always waits to betray the smooth marble front.” This

          in Schiesaro 2009 with his ingenious notion of “Bacchic poetics” in
          which the god of wine in the <em>Odes</em> “stands as the guarantor of a
          freedom which is both thematic and stylistic because he can make
          opposites co-exist: pain and pleasure, <em>tenuitas</em> and <em>grandia,</em> the
          labours of <em>meditari</em> with the emotions of sudden inspiration, the
          paradox that prescribes the poet to be at one and the same time both

                <p>Many scholars have remarked upon the inherently innovative
          quality of Horatian lyric, including: Putnam 1986, 24-25, where he
          suggests that “what we learn as we follow out such a narrative of
          lyrics is a cumulative matter. It is a process of discovery which
          never reaches an end. It forces us, once we have finished any such
          gathering of poems, to begin over again, with earlier questions
          answered and beauties elucidated, but with new issues, needing
          explanations, being raised, and new areas of connotation ever
          opening out”; Miller 1991, 388, arguing that “the lyric
          consciousness of the poet exists as a series of potential poetic
          sequences which together reflect and refract a finite series of
          historical, political and personal issues in an infinite variety of
          ways”; Edmunds 1992, 46, suggesting further that “the careful
          arrangement of the poems in books 1-3 presupposes reading and
          rereading”; and Lowrie 1997, 4, with the idea that Horace achieves
          eternal freshness because his “[l]yric keeps fragmenting any
          monolithic narrative sense.” <a href="#fnref:213" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>Hölscher 2006, 241, suggests that there is a “presentness” in
          Augustan culture that “seems difficult to reconcile with a
          fundamentally retrospective orientation toward an all-dominating
          past.” As he argues, however, “[t]he artistic forms served the
          specific statement – and this statement was not at all
          retrospective, but contemporary and actual.” It is not that the
          Romans are obsessed with the past, for Hölscher, but that they use
          the forms of that past as “universal cultural instrument[s]” to
          produce a “vivid expression of contemporary concepts” (258, 244).
          From a non-classicist perspective Hirsch 1995, 23, claims that the
          “tension between tradition and the modern” can be “momentarily
          resolved in a representation that encapsulates the political fiction
          of a unified nation.” I would argue that the unresolved tensions of
          the Augustan age can be just as effective in a creating a powerful
          political fiction. <a href="#fnref:216" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
