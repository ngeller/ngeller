          <p>Horace is not the only or the first Augustan poet to predict his
          “immortality” – or to do so by imagining his poetry as a monumental
          edifice. Vergil had already done as much in the celebrated proem that
          begins the second half of his <em>Georgics</em>, as the below excerpt from Book
          3 of the poem demonstrates:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
          tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
          primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,          
          Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas;
          primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
          et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
          propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
          Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.
          in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit (<em>G</em>. 3.8-16)<sup id="fnref:233"><a href="#fn:233" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
          
            <p>I must attempt a path by which I too might be able to lift myself from
          the ground and fly victorious through the mouths of men. I returning
          to my native land shall be the first – provided that I live long
          enough – to lead back with me the Muses from the Aonian peak; I shall
          be the first to carry back the Idumean palms to you, Mantua, and I
          will establish a temple of marble in a green field near the water,
          where the great Mincius wanders, slowly curving, and covers its banks
          with tender reeds. In the middle of my temple will be Caesar, and he
          will possess it.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>It is clear from the first two lines of this passage (cf.
          <em>temptanda</em>…<em>ora</em>, 8-9) that Vergil too is speaking of achieving
          immortality through his poetry.<sup id="fnref:234"><a href="#fn:234" class="footnote">2</a></sup> And like Horace he uses the image
          of a monumental structure to stake his claim to it. “I will establish a
          temple of marble” (<em>templum de marmore ponam</em>, 13), the Mantuan poet
          proclaims to his readers, a temple to Augustus Caesar (cf. <em>in</em>
          <em>medio…Caesar erit templumque tenebit</em>, 16). There is one significant
          and obvious difference, of course, between the respective poetic
          statements of these two poets: Horace has already built his monument
          (<em>exegi monumentum</em>…, <em>C</em>. 3.30.1) when he announces his claim to
          immortality while Vergil has yet to erect his “epic” temple, using only
          future verbs (<em>ponam</em>, 13; <em>tenebit</em>, 16) throughout the description of
          the building.</p>
          
          <p>Although it is not hard to understand why this monumental temple has
          been read as a metaphor for what the <em>Aeneid</em> would become,<sup id="fnref:235"><a href="#fn:235" class="footnote">3</a></sup> the
          goal of this chapter and the next one is not to decide whether or not
          this particular structure should be seen as somehow representative of
          the exact epic poem that Vergil would end up writing. Nor will I undergo
          an extensive analysis of the very complex images of this proem from the
          <em>Georgics</em>.<sup id="fnref:236"><a href="#fn:236" class="footnote">4</a></sup> I briefly mention Vergil’s temple here at the start
          only to point out two important elements for a study of his architexture
          in the <em>Aeneid</em>. First, this passage demonstrates explicitly that the
          poet employs the imagery of architecture – and in particular monumental,
          public architecture – in order to give concrete form to his poetics.
          Epic for Vergil is represented here as a grand, seemingly stable
          structure “of marble” (<em>de marmore</em>, 13) in an idyllic, peaceful setting
          (13-14). The proem to <em>Georgics</em> 3 is thus significant for establishing
          monumental architecture as an operative metaphor for Vergil’s epic
          poetry, especially since he is not nearly so explicit in the <em>Aeneid</em> as
          Horace is in his <em>Odes</em> when the latter states that his poem is a
          <em>monumentum</em>. Second, whereas Horace speaks only of his monument’s
          impenetrable exterior and its apparently impervious nature,<sup id="fnref:237"><a href="#fn:237" class="footnote">5</a></sup> the
          poet of the <em>Georgics</em> lets us see inside his temple, right to the
          statue of Augustus Caesar at its center. And it is this focus on what
          lies behind the surface of structures that marks a notable difference in
          Vergil’s own architexture when it comes to his epic.<sup id="fnref:238"><a href="#fn:238" class="footnote">6</a></sup> The
          <em>princeps</em> might possess the temple here in the <em>Georgics</em> in a way that
          gives stability to the building’s meaning through his “numinous power”
          in contrast to the allusive depictions of civil war on the exterior of
          its doors.<sup id="fnref:239"><a href="#fn:239" class="footnote">7</a></sup> In the <em>Aeneid</em>, however, the interiors of many of the
          poem’s structures are much darker, I argue, and filled with forces that
          seek to destabilize order rather than impose it. One of the main
          architextural images of the poem – the Temple of Janus (<em>Aen</em>.
          1.293-296) – is possessed not by an Augustus, in fact, but rather by the
          <em>furor impius</em> of Rome’s past which while temporarily bound seems eager
          to break free at any moment.</p>
          
          <p>The previous chapter examined how Horace constructs generic boundaries
          that while purporting to keep out extrageneric space and time actually
          incorporate them within his traditional lyric dimensions. This way of
          constructing a dynamic and innovative kind of lyric monument through
          what I have termed an inverted <em>recusatio</em> was shown to parallel the
          kind of rhetoric that Augustus also employs in his <em>Res Gestae</em> when
          speaking of his architectural productions in the Roman cityscape. In
          both cases, I argued, the structures created are not as traditional as
          they might first appear; they become enhanced rather by their ability to
          take on the meaning that they claim to exclude through rhetorical
          disavowals. These structures – whether poetic, political, or real – thus
          achieve a dual nature of being old and new simultaneously, with a
          delicate but perfect balancing of tensions between those two extremes.</p>
          
          <p>The analysis of the <em>Aeneid</em> in this dissertation will examine the way
          that Vergil takes the architexture of Horace’s <em>monumentum</em> and flips
          our perspective: the epic poet looks not at the extrageneric forces that
          Horace balances against his lyric traditional structure to enhance its
          stability, but rather at the chaos from Rome’s past that threatens the
          stability of his epic poem <em>qua</em> “monument” from <em>within</em> its
          structure.<sup id="fnref:240"><a href="#fn:240" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The ability of a monument to hide something disruptive
          rather than simply keep out what is inappropriate thus sets the stage
          for a much different understanding of monuments and generic boundaries
          than the one arrived at for Horace’s <em>Odes</em>. Can the <em>Aeneid</em> with its
          epic facade provide a stable frame for a teleological narrative from
          Aeneas to Augustus?<sup id="fnref:241"><a href="#fn:241" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Can it successfully conceal beneath its
          magnificent surface the chaotic violence of Rome’s past from its very
          origins to Vergil’s present? And what does the poem’s success or failure
          in these regards tell us about the idea of the monument in the Augustan
          age? Those are the primary questions that will be asked in this chapter,
          as well as the next one.</p>
          
          <p>My concern will therefore not be to analyze the idea of the city in the
          poem as a “poetological metaphor” for the text.<sup id="fnref:242"><a href="#fn:242" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Nor will I focus
          on the allusions to actual Augustan monuments, as has been the custom of
          many examinations of the poem when discussing architecture’s place in
          it.<sup id="fnref:243"><a href="#fn:243" class="footnote">11</a></sup> I am not attempting, moreover, to analyze closely how the poem
          helps us to understand better the visual aesthetics of actual Roman
          architectural monuments.<sup id="fnref:244"><a href="#fn:244" class="footnote">12</a></sup> What I aim to do is to explore how the
          poem engages with the monumental discourse of Augustan Rome – not only
          employing it to articulate what an epic monument like the <em>Aeneid</em> can
          and cannot do, but at the same time also exploring the strengths and
          weaknesses of the discourse itself in relation to Rome’s past, present,
          and future.<sup id="fnref:245"><a href="#fn:245" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The discussion of the poem along these lines will be divided across two
          chapters due to the vast amount of material in the <em>Aeneid</em> that could
          be analyzed for these purposes. I will leave aside the poem’s named
          <em>monumenta</em> for Chapter V in order to provide a context for them first
          by focusing in this present chapter on the poem’s recurring theme of
          “failed” architecture. I use the term “failed” architecture here to
          refer to edifices that ultimately do not contain the chaos of the past
          that they were built to conceal, but rather release it when their
          boundaries become compromised, whether literally or
          metaphorically.<sup id="fnref:246"><a href="#fn:246" class="footnote">14</a></sup> These constructions consist most notably of
          certain caves and labyrinths in the poem, examined below in Part 1 and
          Part 2, respectively. The former of this pair comprises not “natural”
          caves, one should note, but <em>moles</em> – unnatural, constructed objects
          that are erected to contain the chaos which the <em>Aeneid</em> reveals to be a
          central part of Roman history from the start. These include Aeolus’ Cave
          in Book 1, the Trojan Horse in Book 2 (which is also described several
          times as a “cave”), and the Cave of Cacus in Book 8. With an examination
          of the labyrinths in Books 5 and 6 of the poem I will transition in Part
          2 to structures whose failure to restrain the chaotic forces of the past
          occurs at a less literal level: the walls of the labyrinths are not
          broken, <em>per se</em>, but are revealed to be always shifting and thus unable
          to contain within themselves the past disorders and mistakes (<em>errores</em>)
          they were designed to keep hidden. The point of this chapter will
          therefore be to illustrate how such structures fail to maintain not just
          their physical boundaries, but in the case of labyrinths often their
          “epistemological” boundaries, as well, since what they appear to mean on
          the outside is shown to be just as susceptible to collapse as their
          material structure.<sup id="fnref:247"><a href="#fn:247" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

          <p><br /></p>
          
          <p>Before we begin to look at these “failed” structures, however, let us
          briefly return to where this chapter began. The immense scholarly
          attention given to the passage from the <em>Georgics</em> quoted at the start
          of this chapter points to something else which it is important to keep
          in mind during the following examination of Vergil’s architexture:
          whatever the poet might have meant his temple to signify at the time
          that he wrote the proem, it has not stopped future scholars from
          bestowing their own interpretations on it – and thus transforming the
          meaning of the structure into anything from an “abandoned project” to
          the <em>Aeneid</em> itself.<sup id="fnref:248"><a href="#fn:248" class="footnote">16</a></sup> The present chapter and the following one
          will explore how the architexture of the <em>Aeneid</em> illustrates that such
          an instability of meaning is not only inherent to monumentality, as was
          suggested above in Chapter II;<sup id="fnref:249"><a href="#fn:249" class="footnote">17</a></sup> more importantly, the poem
          demonstrates the need for one always to be aware of this instability
          when “reading” <em>monumenta</em> – whether poetic ones, such as the <em>Aeneid</em>,
          or real ones in Rome’s physical landscape, such as the Temple of Janus.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-1-the-constructed-caves-of-the-aeneid">Part 1. The Constructed Caves of the <em>Aeneid</em></h3>
          
          <p>A cave is normally a natural “place” with firm boundaries that separate
          inside from outside,<sup id="fnref:250"><a href="#fn:250" class="footnote">18</a></sup> distinguish light from dark,<sup id="fnref:251"><a href="#fn:251" class="footnote">19</a></sup> and can
          even house primordial forces that defy rationalization and
          structure.<sup id="fnref:252"><a href="#fn:252" class="footnote">20</a></sup> For the Romans, however, caves could be constructed, as
          well, and in a way that blurred those seemingly rigid boundaries.<sup id="fnref:253"><a href="#fn:253" class="footnote">21</a></sup>
          In the case of decorated grottoes, for instance, aristocrats and
          emperors could enjoy nature in safety and under their control as part of
          their domain – thus breaking down the distinction between the natural
          and the artificial.<sup id="fnref:254"><a href="#fn:254" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In their poetry, moreover, Roman authors used
          caves in a similar way to destabilize the boundaries of what is crafted
          and what is untouched by human beings. In Vergil’s bucolic poems, for
          example, Frederick Jones has recently shown how caves are one of the
          “various apparently natural features in the <em>Eclogues</em> [that] turn out
          not to be unequivocally natural”; according to Jones, in fact, caves
          play an important role as an “element of bucolic iconography,”
          representing an ideal space for bucolic song that is at once natural and
          artificial.<sup id="fnref:255"><a href="#fn:255" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> examined below are not entirely natural,
          either. They are constructions – <em>moles</em> – imposed upon nature to
          contain the destructive, chaotic forces of the past that seek to escape
          and upset the established order of things.<sup id="fnref:256"><a href="#fn:256" class="footnote">24</a></sup> It is the way that
          these caves <em>fail</em> to keep such forces at bay, however, that makes them
          relevant to a discussion of Vergilian architexture. It is not merely
          that they become a marked space for epic song; they help rather to
          illustrate what happens when someone – whether a god, an emperor, or a
          poet – attempts to impose a structure upon the chaotic forces of the
          past that exist as part of Rome’s history from its very origins. The
          role of caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> is thus two-fold: they are simultaneously
          architectural in the way they try to restrain the violence of the past
          and <em>anti</em>-architectural in the sense that their own failure to do so
          illustrates the very fragility of such restraints.<sup id="fnref:257"><a href="#fn:257" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
          
          <h4 id="i-aeolus-cave">(i) Aeolus’ Cave</h4>
          
          <p>When readers (ancient or modern) come to Aeolus’ Cave in Book I of the
          <em>Aeneid</em> they might have certain expectations based on the passage in
          Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em> where Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag full of winds in
          order to make his journey back home a little easier. Those expectations
          are quickly disappointed, however.<sup id="fnref:258"><a href="#fn:258" class="footnote">26</a></sup> And the dramatic changes which
          Vergil makes to his Homeric model provide a useful starting point for an
          examination of an architectural feature in the form of constructed caves
          that appears again and again in his epic poem.</p>
          
          <p>Let us start by comparing the two structures that Aeolus inhabits in
          each poem. Below is a short excerpt from Homer that describes Aeolus’
          domain and activities in the <em>Odyssey</em>:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>We reached the island of Aeolia. There lived
          Aeolus Hippotades, dear to gods immortal,
          on a floating island, a wall of unbreakable bronze
          all around it, and the smooth rock ran sheer up.
          His twelve children were also in the palace,</p>
          
            <p>[…]</p>
          
            <p>They always dine beside their dear father and devoted mother.
          Countless good things lie beside them, and the house,
          steaming with sacrifice, echoes around the courtyard 10
          by day, and at night they sleep again beside their venerable wives
          in blankets and in corded beds.<sup id="fnref:259"><a href="#fn:259" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Homer’s Aeolus lives in a palace (ἐνὶ μεγάροις, 5) with his twelve
          children – a place of constant feasting and merriment where Odysseus and
          his comrades spend a month enjoying the king’s hospitality while telling
          of their journey thus far. The “wall of unbreakable bronze” (τεῖχος
          χάλκεον ἄρρηκτον, 3) and “sheer” rock cliffs (cf. λισσὴ…πέτρη, 4) that
          surround Aeolus’ kingdom are clearly intended to be barriers to keep
          others out of this small piece of paradise.<sup id="fnref:260"><a href="#fn:260" class="footnote">28</a></sup> Vergil gives us a
          rather different picture of Aeolus’ “kingdom” when he narrates Juno’s
          visit there early in Book 1 of the <em>Aeneid</em>:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Talia flammato secum dea corde uolutans
          nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus Austris,
          Aeoliam uenit. hic uasto rex Aeolus antro
          luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras
          imperio premit ac uinclis et carcere frenat.
          illi indignantes magna cum murmure montis
          circum claustra fremunt. (Verg. <em>Aen</em>. 1.50-56)</p>
          
            <p>Debating such things with herself in her inflamed heart the goddess
          arrived at Aeolia, the land of the storm-clouds, places filled with
          raging southwest winds. Here in a vast cave Aeolus as king keeps in
          check the winds struggling to break free and the boisterous storms,
          and restrains them in chains and a prison. They angrily roar at their
          bonds as the mountain rumbles loudly.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Aeolus’ country is certainly no island paradise in the <em>Aeneid</em>, but
          instead is a place “filled with raging southwest winds” (<em>feta
          furentibus Austris</em>, 51). His home is still immense – but only a cave
          (<em>uasto…antro</em>, 52).<sup id="fnref:261"><a href="#fn:261" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Aeolus’ companions are not his family,
          moreover, but “winds struggling to break free and boisterous storms”
          (<em>luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras</em>, 53), which he must keep
          under control in a sort of “prison” (<em>carcere</em>, 54). And even then these
          unwilling inhabitants continue to roar at the constraints that bind them
          (<em>indignantes…circum claustra fremunt</em>, 55-56). This island prison is
          certainly not the impression one gets from Aeolus’ palace in the
          <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
          
          <p>I will return to examine more fully the nature of the architecture in
          this passage below. It is important, however, to consider beforehand
          also the charge that is given to Aeolus in both poems. First, from
          Homer:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Aeolus gave Odysseus a leather bag, of a nine year-old ox he’d
          skinned, and bound the ways of the blustering winds in it
          for Cronion had made him master of the winds,
          both to start and stop the ones he wishes.<sup id="fnref:262"><a href="#fn:262" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>All Aeolus has to do in the <em>Odyssey</em> apparently is put the winds in a
          bag – and everything is suddenly calm for Odysseus to go on his way. He
          is not the jailor of the winds as Aeolus is in the <em>Aeneid</em>; on the
          contrary, he simply controls them according to his fancy (cf. ὅν κ’
          ἐθέλῃσι, 22). Homer’s Aeolus is thus “an authoritarian figure who
          exercises absolute and peremptory judgment.”<sup id="fnref:263"><a href="#fn:263" class="footnote">31</a></sup> This could not be
          further from the nature of Aeolus’ task in Vergil’s poem, as the
          following passage demonstrates:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…celsa sedet Aeolus arce
          sceptra tenens mollitque animas et temperat iras.
          ni faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum
          quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per auras;
          sed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris
          hoc metuens molemque et montis insuper altos
          imposuit, regemque dedit qui foedere certo
          et premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas. (<em>Aen</em>. 1.56-63)</p>
          
            <p>Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, as he both
          softens their spirits and checks their wraths. If he should not do
          this, they would no doubt carry away the seas and the lands and the
          vast sky in no time and sweep it all with them through the breezes.
          But fearing this would happen the all-powerful father hid them in dark
          caverns, placing a <em>moles</em> and high mountains above, and he gave them
          a king who under a fixed agreement would know how to restrain them and
          – when given the order – to loosen the reins.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>It is Aeolus’ job to make sure that he “checks the wraths” of the winds
          (<em>temperat iras</em>, 57); for if he should not, they would “sweep away”
          (<em>uerrant</em>, 59) everything – sea, land, sky – in their uncontrollable
          rage. Jupiter realizing this (in fact, “fearing this,” <em>hoc metuens</em>,
          61) built Aeolus’ Cave to ensure that there could be order in the
          cosmos. He then made Aeolus the “king” (<em>regem</em>, 62) of the winds. This
          charge is given to Aeolus not so that he can use them as he pleases, as
          he does in Homer; it is “under a fixed agreement” (<em>foedere certo</em>, 62)
          here that Aeolus is said to control the winds “when given the order”
          (<em>iussus</em>, 63), presumably, by Jupiter himself. This is not then a
          simple matter of putting the winds in a bag. The cosmic significance of
          Aeolus’ charge in the <em>Aeneid</em> signals a need for a different kind of
          architecture – one not simply for display, or one that is intended to
          keep things out, but rather one which would contain, or “hide” (cf.
          <em>abdidit</em>, 60), that which would upset the established order of
          Jupiter.<sup id="fnref:264"><a href="#fn:264" class="footnote">32</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>But why speak of this cave as architectural? Aeolus’ palace in the
          <em>Aeneid</em> is a “vast cave” (cf. <em>vasto</em>…<em>antro</em>, 52; <em>speluncis</em>, 60),
          after all. It is important to note, though, that it is also an
          <em>artificial</em> cave constructed by Jupiter himself: <em>molemque et montis
          insuper altos</em> / <em>imposuit</em> (61-62). In other words, this mountain is
          not natural, <em>per se</em>, but <em>imposed</em> upon nature by the king of the
          gods. The artificiality of this “mountain” is emphasized, moreover, by
          the poet’s identification of it as a <em>moles</em>, that is, a large, usually
          man-made structure often built as a means to create land over a body of
          water.<sup id="fnref:265"><a href="#fn:265" class="footnote">33</a></sup> At the same time, however, this is no ordinary <em>moles</em> that
          functions merely as a dam or as a means to extend the land into the
          sea.<sup id="fnref:266"><a href="#fn:266" class="footnote">34</a></sup> The structure is meant rather to contain the chaos that
          apparently used to run rampant in a time before any order. One could
          even say that Aeolus’ Cave is the very <em>first</em> structure in the sense
          that it necessarily precedes all others: if the Aeolus should not
          restrain the winds in this <em>moles</em>, the poet warns, “they would no doubt
          carry away the seas and the lands and the vast sky in no time and sweep
          it all with them through the breezes” (<em>ni faciat, maria ac terras
          caelumque profundum</em> / <em>quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per
          auras</em>, 1.58-59). Nothing could stand for very long, in other words,
          without this massive structure to keep the winds in check. It is
          possible, therefore, to see a double meaning in Aeolus’ statement to
          Juno that gods have made him <em>tempestatum</em>… <em>potentem</em> (1.80), namely,
          that he is not only “powerful over the storms,” but over “time”
          itself,<sup id="fnref:267"><a href="#fn:267" class="footnote">35</a></sup> since there would be nothing – no structures, no monuments
          – to mark the passage of time if the winds were to roam free as
          previously in what could only be an eternal chaos.<sup id="fnref:268"><a href="#fn:268" class="footnote">36</a></sup> It is
          architecture, then, which the <em>Aeneid</em> suggests as the very craft which
          gives structure not only to space but even to time against the chaos
          which seems to be a constant in the story of Rome from the start.<sup id="fnref:269"><a href="#fn:269" class="footnote">37</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It makes a certain amount of sense that the first building to appear in
          Vergil’s narrative would also be the primordial edifice of his epic
          cosmos.<sup id="fnref:270"><a href="#fn:270" class="footnote">38</a></sup> With such significance, however, it is important to note
          again that there is something quite unnatural about this <em>moles</em>. Aeolus
          must subdue the winds struggling to break free (<em>luctantis uentos</em>, 53)
          with his “power” (<em>imperio</em>, 54) and – even more unnatural – he must do
          so by “restrain[ing] them in chains and a prison” (<em>uinclis et carcere
          frenat</em>, 54) that his cave represents. Indeed, these winds are further
          described as <em>indignantes</em> at their imprisonment,<sup id="fnref:271"><a href="#fn:271" class="footnote">39</a></sup> as they “roar at
          their locks” (<em>circum claustra fremunt</em>, 56). This imposition of a
          structure upon a clearly unwilling element of nature is thus both
          explicitly highlighted and rather extreme – especially when compared,
          for instance, to the mere “bag” that Aeolus uses to hold the winds in
          the <em>Odyssey</em>. The fact that the next part of the line after the caesura
          calls Aeolus’ residence a lofty citadel (<em>celsa</em>…<em>arce</em>, 56) further
          illustrates that this is certainly not as natural a cave as it might
          have appeared at first.<sup id="fnref:272"><a href="#fn:272" class="footnote">40</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The above analysis of this primeval edifice thus far has highlighted two
          important points about the place of architecture in Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em>:
          [1] nature in the poem is filled with chaotic and violent forces and
          [2] the structures that try to impose order upon them are not accepted
          willingly by those forces. What is even more significant perhaps for
          this present study is the fact that this “first” structure eventually
          fails – even if only temporarily – to contain those forces: Aeolus is
          easily bribed by Juno to set free the winds and cracks open the <em>moles</em>
          imposed upon them in order to give them a breach from which to
          depart.<sup id="fnref:273"><a href="#fn:273" class="footnote">41</a></sup> This failure is particularly noteworthy because it means
          that even a structure built by the “all-mighty” (<em>omnipotens</em>, 60)
          Jupiter cannot keep these forces in check permanently.</p>
          
          <p>It is not simply “violence suppressed and then coming to the surface”
          that is the “all-encompassing motif” of this opening scene,<sup id="fnref:274"><a href="#fn:274" class="footnote">42</a></sup> but a
          much more primordial kind of chaos from the deep past that must be
          overcome for order to exist at all. Such cosmic order is quickly
          regained, of course, when Neptune emerges from the sea to chastise the
          winds.<sup id="fnref:275"><a href="#fn:275" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Yet the fact that the “first” building in the poem fails to
          accomplish the purpose for which it was built – if only for a short
          while – should make readers somewhat suspicious from the start of
          architecture’s ability to maintain the stability of its imposition on
          these buried chaotic forces of the past. The below examination of other
          caves in the poem will show that the failure of such structures to hold
          in check these forces is in fact a common theme throughout the epic.</p>
          
          <p>Before I turn to those other failed structures, however, it is essential
          at this point to introduce another edifice in Book 1 that I will return
          to several times in my analysis of the epic’s architexture. After
          discussing in very general terms the history of Rome for the sake of the
          distressed Venus, whose son Aeneas has been tossed about on the sea by
          Aeolus’ storms, the father of the gods goes into great detail to depict
          what lurks inside of the Temple of Janus in Vergil’s own day:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…dirae ferro et compagibus artis
          claudentur Belli portae; Furor impius intus
          saeua sedens super arma et centum uinctus aenis
          post tergum nodis fremet horridus ore cruento. (<em>Aen</em>. 1.293-296)</p>
          
            <p>Those terrible gates of War will be closed with tight, iron bounds.
          Seated within upon cruel weapons and bound by a hundred bronze knots
          behind his back impious <em>Furor</em> will give a terrifying roar from his
          mouth stained with blood.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The imagery in this passage is remarkably similar in several respects to
          features of Aeolus’ Cave examined above.<sup id="fnref:276"><a href="#fn:276" class="footnote">44</a></sup> The Temple of Janus is
          also presented as a sort of prison that has been bolted shut (<em>ferro et
          compagibus artis</em> / <em>claudentur</em>, 293-294). Just like the winds,
          moreover, the main prisoner – the personified <em>Furor</em> – is bound with
          chains: his hands have been tied behind his back by a thousand brazen
          knots (cf. <em>centum uinctus aenis</em> / <em>post tergum nodis</em>, 295-296).
          Finally, the main verb, <em>fremet</em> (“roars,” 296), almost cannot but
          remind a reader of the winds who also are said to <em>fremunt</em> at their own
          bonds (<em>circum claustra</em> <em>fremunt</em>, 56) not too much earlier in Book 1.
          There is no Augustus at the core of this temple as in the proem of
          <em>Georgics</em> 3. The space in the <em>Aeneid</em> is occupied instead by a
          personification of disorder itself that though chained is definitely not
          a willing prisoner.</p>
          
          <p>In both of these scenes, then, the depiction of architecture represents
          it as a means of containing (or even hiding) a violent, chaotic force
          from the past that threatens to break down established structures and
          general order. Given the proximity in the poem of these two buildings at
          the very start of the epic, however, it does not seem inappropriate to
          question the ability of the temple to continue to keep such a force in
          check. If a cavernous <em>moles</em> built by Jupiter himself fails to contain
          this chaos permanently, who is to say that the Temple of Janus might not
          one day crack, as well? Rome might be an <em>imperium</em> <em>sine fine</em> (“an
          empire without boundary,” <em>Aen</em>. 1.279) when it comes to its ability to
          expand without limit. There <em>are</em> boundaries that exist within it,
          though, at its very center and which contain a force – civil strife –
          perhaps even more destructive than anything at its outer borders, as any
          Roman living through the decades of civil war in the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
          could attest. In short, the <em>Aeneid</em> from the start configures the story
          of Rome as a constant struggle to contain a violent chaos that seeks to
          breakdown any order imposed upon it – from Aeolus’ Cave at the very
          start of time all the way to the Temple of Janus in the Augustan age
          itself.</p>
          
          <p>The first 300 lines of the <em>Aeneid</em> present a much different
          understanding of architecture than what is found in Horace’s <em>Odes</em>
          where his <em>monumentum</em> of a poem was able to resist indefinitely the
          storms of time that wear down all human achievement.<sup id="fnref:277"><a href="#fn:277" class="footnote">45</a></sup> In the
          <em>Aeneid</em>, on the other hand, it is the chaos <em>within</em> the structure that
          is the point of interest. Aeolus’ Cave sets the stage from the very
          start of the poem for a particular kind of architextural boundary that
          does not help one to expand what one has so much as to enclose within
          that which would threaten the stability of everything that one has
          established. The failure of this kind of architecture to contain such
          forces repeats throughout the <em>Aeneid</em> in other “caves,” as well as in
          the poem’s labyrinths, and should alert the reader to the fragile nature
          of the more triumphant kind of architecture that the poem presents in
          the form of <em>monumenta</em>, particularly in Book 8. As the next chapter
          will demonstrate, in fact, the architexture of Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em> finds a
          place between these two kinds of architecture: it is at once a
          monumental facade that makes a claim to a specific, glorious meaning
          <em>and</em> a “failed” monument that shows the cracks in its magnificent epic
          frame, revealing the chaos of the past lurking behind it.</p>
          
          <h4 id="ii-the-trojan-horse">(ii) The Trojan Horse</h4>
          
          <p>Although the Cave of Aeolus was built by Jupiter, it ultimately fails to
          contain permanently the chaotic forces of the deep past that threaten
          the order he has established on a cosmic level. Failed attempts to
          contain such forces also occur on a smaller scale in the poem, as can be
          witnessed, for instance, in the case of the Trojan Horse. This section
          will show that the various descriptions in Book 2 of the Trojan Horse –
          another unnatural <em>moles</em><sup id="fnref:278"><a href="#fn:278" class="footnote">46</a></sup> – bear a striking resemblance to the way
          that the poet described Aeolus’ Cave analyzed above. There are certain
          differences between the two structures, however, and analyzing these
          will help to flesh out additional important aspects of “failed”
          architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em>, especially from the perspective of those
          who see only the present surface and are unmindful of the past chaos
          within.</p>
          
          <p>Let us start where Aeneas himself begins his narrative of the fall of
          Troy at the beginning of Book 2:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…fracti bello fatisque repulsi
          ductores Danaum, tot iam labentibus annis,

            <p>When the commanders of the Greeks were broken by war and driven back
          by fates – so many years having slipped by already – they build a
          horse the equivalent of a mountain with the divine craft of Pallas
          Athena and weave its ribs from the chopped-up wood [of their ships].
          They pretend that it is an offering for their safe return: this is the
          rumor that spreads. Secretly they enclose the bodies of men selected
          by lot there in its dark flank, within its vast caverns, filling its
          womb with an armed band of soldiers.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>With nothing else left to try the Greek leaders turn to trickery in
          order to take the city of Troy. What is immediately noteworthy about
          this passage is the tension between natural and artificial – a
          characteristic already noted above in the description of Aeolus’ Cave in
          Book 1. First of all, one usually does not “build a horse”
          (<em>equum</em>…<em>aedificant</em>, 15-16), or use pieces of ships to “weave ribs”
          (<em>intexunt</em>…<em>costas</em>, 16).<sup id="fnref:279"><a href="#fn:279" class="footnote">47</a></sup> There is again something unnatural
          about this construction for the Greeks who are doing it all with the
          help of another god, that is, “with the divine craft of Pallas Athena”
          (<em>divina Palladis arte</em>, 15).<sup id="fnref:280"><a href="#fn:280" class="footnote">48</a></sup> And it is not just that they are
          building a horse; more than that, they are raising it to be “the
          equivalent of a mountain” (<em>instar montis</em>, 15), rivaling the natural
          with their artificial construction. The Horse is not merely as big as a
          mountain, though. Just as with the <em>moles</em> that Jupiter constructs to
          house the winds the Trojan Horse is also said to contain a violent force
          “within its vast caverns” (<em>penitus</em>…<em>cavernas</em> / <em>ingentis</em>,
          19-20),<sup id="fnref:281"><a href="#fn:281" class="footnote">49</a></sup> namely, the Greeks who “fill its womb with an armed band
          of soldiers” (<em>uterumque armato milite complent</em>, 20).<sup id="fnref:282"><a href="#fn:282" class="footnote">50</a></sup> This idea
          that the Greeks have somehow “impregnated” the Horse calls to mind the
          very first detail the reader learns about Aeolus’ land: it too is
          “pregnant with winds” (cf. <em>feta uentis</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.51) – furious winds
          that Jupiter has implanted within his artificial construction. The
          Greeks not only “build” (<em>aedificant</em>, 16) a horse, then, but construct
          it as a <em>moles</em> to rival even a mountain together with the dark caves it
          might contain. Both of these ideas suggest an overstepping of what is
          natural for one to construct. But the poet goes a step further by
          implying that the Greeks even impregnate it (cf. <em>uterumque</em>…
          <em>complent</em>, 20), too, with men ready to destroy the city of Troy.<sup id="fnref:283"><a href="#fn:283" class="footnote">51</a></sup>
          The poet makes it explicit in several way therefore that the Trojan
          Horse from its very first description is represented like Aeolus’ Cave
          as an artificial construction that contains violent, destructive forces
          of the past which seek to destroy all order – in this case, the Greeks
          with their desire to overturn the order of Trojan life and the city that
          contains it.</p>
          
          <p>It is not just the similarity to the description of Aeolus’ Cave that
          brings the Trojan Horse in dialogue with the chaotic scene from Book 1
          examined in the previous section; more importantly, the ultimate
          “failure” of the Trojan Horse to contain its own chaotic forces likewise
          calls to mind the unleashing of the winds by Aeolus. When the Greeks
          slip out of the Horse at night they too introduce a chaotic force that
          will end up destroying all order and bringing about the city’s literal
          downfall.<sup id="fnref:284"><a href="#fn:284" class="footnote">52</a></sup> The close connection between these two destructive,
          chaotic forces – the winds of Aeolus and the Greeks in the Horse – is in
          fact anticipated by the language which the poet uses at the very start
          of this process. When Aeneas awakes from his dream featuring Hector’s
          ghost, the Trojan hero goes outside and describes the chaos he beholds
          with the following simile:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>in segetem ueluti cum flamma <strong>furentibus Austris</strong>
          incidit, aut rapidus montano flumine torrens
          sternit agros, sternit sata laeta boumque labores
          praecipitesque trahit siluas… (<em>Aen</em>. 2.304-307)</p>
          
            <p>Just as when fire falls upon the grain field <strong>with raging southwest
          winds</strong>, or the swift torrent from a mountain river covers the fields,
          covers the bountiful harvests, and drags along with it the toils of
          bulls and falling trees.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The most pertinent part of this frightening simile is the end of the
          first line: “with raging southwest winds” (<em>furentibus Austris</em>, 304).
          The only other time that Vergil uses this particular phrase – and in the
          exact same position in the meter no less – is when the poet describes
          Aeolus’ Cave examined above, where the king’s land is also said to be
          filled with <em>furentibus Austris</em> (1.51).<sup id="fnref:285"><a href="#fn:285" class="footnote">53</a></sup> It is not a coincidence
          that the men who come from the horse are compared to the furious winds
          so precisely: the poet is foreshadowing through this simile the parallel
          nature of these forces of violence from the past that break free of
          their bounds to wreak havoc on the established order of things – whether
          it be in the middle of the sea, or inside the stable, long-standing city
          of Troy.</p>
          
          <p>There are also two important differences, however, between Aeolus’s Cave
          and the Trojan Horse that complicate the theme of “failed” architecture
          in the <em>Aeneid</em>. First, the primary purpose for the construction of the
          former structure is to prevent the chaos it is holding from destroying
          all order – something the <em>moles</em> fails to accomplish temporarily at
          least when Aeolus releases the winds. In the case of the Horse, however,
          there are different motivations for such a construction: the Greeks
          build it in order to hold a destructive force that will eventually
          destroy the solid citadel of Troy when unleashed. In other words, the
          monumental horse is a case of an intentionally failed piece of
          architecture, that is, an edifice designed to “crack” and release the
          chaos from the past that it contains.</p>
          
          <p>This does not mean, though, that the purpose of the Horse is apparent to
          all. And the ambiguity of its meaning suggests a second important
          difference between the two artificial <em>moles</em>. Aeolus’ Cave seems to be
          far away from the realm of mortals in the middle of the sea; its
          external appearance – be it an immense mountain – is not too important.
          The Trojan Horse is an explicitly monumental structure, on the other
          hand, one meant to elicit the awe of those who see it. The purpose of
          its construction is to create a facade that allows the structure to
          express another meaning than the one for which it was actually built. It
          will be easiest perhaps to see this ambiguity of meaning which exists
          between what one sees on the surface and what lies beneath by examining
          the different ways that the Trojan priest Laocoon and the Greek
          “runaway” Sinon craft their respective arguments regarding the Horse’s
          meaning, as well as the relative success of each.</p>
          
          <p>The priest of Neptune makes several remarks that encourage his fellow
          Trojans to look past the magnificent exterior of the Horse:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>…“o miseri, quae tanta insania, ciues?
          creditis auectos hostis? aut ulla putatis
          dona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Vlixes?
          aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achiui,
          aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros
          inspectura domos uenturaque desuper urbi,
          aut aliquis latet error: equo ne credite, Teucri.
          quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.” (<em>Aen</em>. 2.42-49)</p>
          
            <p>“My misfortunate fellow citizens, what so great madness is this? Do
          you believe the enemy has sailed away? Or do you think that any gifts
          of the Greeks are without tricks? Is that the Ulysses we know? Either
          the Achaeans are hidden closed within this wood, or this war-machine
          has been constructed against our walls so that it can inspect our
          homes and come into our city from above, or some <em>error</em> lies hidden:
          do not believe in this horse, Trojans. Whatever it is, I fear even
          Greeks bearing gifts.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>For Laocoon, at least, this structure is no doubt hiding Greek “tricks”
          (<em>dolis Danaum</em>, 44) and/or Greeks themselves (cf. <em>occultantur Achiui</em>,
          45). It is a structure, moreover, that Laoccon claims has been
          “constructed against [Troy’s] walls” (<em>in…fabricata est</em>…<em>muros</em>,
          46): it will not only look over the city, but the very homes (<em>domos</em>,
          47) of its inhabitants – bypassing the distinction between private and
          public in the urban realm. What it contains Laocoon himself does not
          know (<em>quidquid id est</em>, 49) – only that some <em>error</em>, some devious,
          unexpected outcome lies hidden (<em>aliquis latet error</em>, 48).<sup id="fnref:286"><a href="#fn:286" class="footnote">54</a></sup> This
          is no ordinary “horse.” And the priest is right to urge his citizens not
          to put their faith in it (<em>equo ne credite, Teucri</em>, 49).</p>
          
          <p>The interpretation that Laocoon presents might be correct: he is
          certainly right, after all, to try to reveal the sinister contents that
          the monumental facade hides. That does him little good, though, as he
          cannot pierce the exterior to the truth underneath:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>sic fatus ualidis ingentem uiribus hastam
          in latus inque feri curuam compagibus aluum
          contorsit. stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso
          insonuere cauae gemitumque dedere cauernae (<em>Aen</em>. 2.50-53)</p>
          
            <p>When he had said this [Laocoon] hurled his great spear with mighty
          strength into the side of the beast, into the belly round with joints.
          The spear stood there trembling, and at the strike of the womb the
          hollow caverns echoed and let go a groan.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In this passage, too, the reader can see again not only the suggestion
          that the “beast” is in some way pregnant (<em>curuum</em>…<em>aluum</em>, 51;
          <em>uteroque recusso</em>, 52), but also the image of the Horse as a kind of
          cave: the “hollow caverns” (<em>cavae</em>…<em>cavernae</em>, 53) resound and give a
          groan when struck by the priest’s weapon. Laocoon’s actions might even
          remind the reader of the way that Aeolus used his spear to release the
          winds and set them about on their rampage: as the king of the winds is
          said to have struck the mountain with his spear (<em>cauum conuersa cuspide
          montem</em> / <em>impulit in latus</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.81-82), Laocoon also strikes into
          the side of the horse (<em>in latus</em>, 51) with his spear (<em>hastam</em>, 50).
          Yet even if he is able to hit the structure, the priest is unable to
          reveal what lies beneath its surface within the Horse’s artificially
          constructed cavern.<sup id="fnref:287"><a href="#fn:287" class="footnote">55</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Laocoon is not the builder of the Horse. Unlike Aeolus, moreover, the
          Trojan priest is not the owner of the “beast,” either. It is as a mere
          spectator that Laocoon fails in his attempt to display the <em>error</em> that
          lies hidden within the facade. His inability to reveal the hidden
          meaning of the structure is not insignificant, however, when compared to
          the much different outcome that the Greek “runaway” Sinon encounters
          upon his explanation of the Horse’s meaning. Sinon is in fact much more
          successful in the way that he determines the meaning of the Horse and
          its monumental size for its Trojan onlookers. And it is important for
          the discussion of Vergilian <em>monumenta</em> below in the following chapter
          to consider the reasons for Sinon’s success in contrast to the failure
          of Laocoon to control the meaning of the structure.</p>
          
          <p>Below is what the crafty Greek claims in response to Priam’s question as
          to why this <em>moles</em> of a Horse was built in the first place:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hanc pro Palladia moniti, pro numine laesa
          effigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.
          hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem
          roboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,
          ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset
          neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri. (<em>Aen</em>. 2.183-188)</p>
          
            <p>They constructed this effigy at [Calchus’] warning on behalf of the
          Palladium, for the sake of the wounded divine will, so that it could
          atone for their grim crime. Yet Calchus ordered them to erect this
          immense <em>moles</em> of woven oak and build it to the sky, in order that it
          could not be received by your gates or led into your walls, and so
          that it could not watch over your people in the course of their
          ancient religious rites.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>It was the Greek prophet Calchas, according to Sinon, who ordered the
          Greeks to “erect this immense <em>moles</em>” (<em>hanc…immmensam…attollere
          molem</em>, 185) in order to atone for stealing the Palladium from Troy. The
          sly Greek makes it look like a regular (albeit massive) offering: he
          uses none of the language that seeks to blur the distinction between
          natural and artificial – not even calling the structure a “horse” at any
          point. He focuses on the grand exterior, explaining that structure was
          built so big that it would be able neither to be led into gates and
          walls of a city (cf. <em>ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset</em>, 187)
          nor to be worshipped under the Trojans’ traditional religion (cf. <em>neu
          populurn antiqua sub religione tueri</em>, 188).<sup id="fnref:288"><a href="#fn:288" class="footnote">56</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>By focusing on the exterior Sinon succeeds where Laocoon failed in
          persuading his fellow onlookers of the meaning of the monumental
          <em>moles</em>.<sup id="fnref:289"><a href="#fn:289" class="footnote">57</a></sup> And the inclusion of the Horse in the city despite
          Sinon’s rhetorical “warnings” is significant for illustrating the
          effects that grand facades can have on their spectators. The Trojans are
          completely unaware of the import of what they are doing and refuse to
          see the clear signs of trouble: for instance, when the Horse halts four
          times on the threshold and the weapons that it contains rattle, the
          inhabitants of the city seem oblivious (<em>immemores</em>) to the sounds that
          the beast makes and instead “blinded with fury” (<em>caeci</em>…<em>furore</em>)
          place the <em>monstrum</em> in the center of the city (cf. <em>Aen</em>.
          2.240-243).<sup id="fnref:290"><a href="#fn:290" class="footnote">58</a></sup> Again, it is important for the discussion below in
          Chapter V to stress here the effects that this kind of monumental
          architecture can have on people – that is, to make them <em>immemores</em> of,
          or <em>caeci</em> to, what could lie behind a grand facade, or what monsters of
          one’s past a monumental structure could contain.</p>
          
          <p>The Trojan Horse therefore demonstrates another important element of the
          failed structures in the poem, namely, the way that a monumental
          exterior can make those who behold a massive <em>moles</em> unmindful of what
          fury of the past it could be concealing. The need for a critical
          approach to reading beneath the surface of such structures is suggested
          not only by Laocoon’s inability to persuade his fellow Trojans to look
          beyond the awesome facade of the Horse; more than that, it is the
          relative ease with which Sinon tricks the Trojans by focusing their
          attention on the Horse’s extraordinary frame that makes an ability to
          read beneath the surface so critical. The Trojans are blinded by the
          monumental facade of the horse – and it costs them dearly. The poet’s
          narrative of the Trojan Horse is thus similar to his account of Cacus’
          cave in the way that it too should make one suspicious of architecture’s
          ability to contain the chaos inherent to the past in the Vergil’s story
          of Rome. The poet’s telling of Troy’s downfall warns his readers at the
          same time to be suspicious of monumental structures, in particular,
          especially those whose splendid exteriors can make one forgetful of the
          chaos that might lie below their marvelous surfaces.</p>
          
          <p>The close parallel of the Horse’s imagery with that of Aeolus’ Cave in
          the previous book of the poem should again make the reader consider
          whether it is wise (or even possible) to hold at bay the forces of chaos
          from the past that these cavernous <em>moles</em> contain. Is the Temple of
          Janus – a structure placed at the center of Rome as the Horse was at
          Troy – another construction that could eventually fail and let loose
          again the violent chaos of Rome’s past? The Trojan Horse and the Cave of
          Aeolus do not offer the epic’s readers much confidence in architecture’s
          ability to contain such a force; if anything, in fact, they demonstrate
          vividly the disaster which the release of such a force can wreak,
          whether on a city or the world at large.</p>
          
          <h4 id="iii-cacus-cave">(iii) Cacus’ Cave</h4>
          
          <p>In Book 8 of the poem Aeneas sees the site that eventually will become
          Rome. And even at that time in the distant past there are <em>monumenta</em>
          there. Evander is Aeneas’ guide and reveals to him “the remains and
          monuments of the men of old” (<em>reliquias ueterumque…monumenta
          uirorum</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 8.356, cf. 8.312). The next chapter will examine
          exactly what such <em>monumenta</em> might mean to Evander, to Aeneas, and to
          the contemporary Roman reader. It is necessary first, however, to look
          at another important constructed cave that appears in this book of the
          poem, namely, the Cave of Cacus. This cave also contains an evil,
          chaotic force that existed in Rome’s distant past – on the very site of
          Rome no less – in ways not dissimilar to Aeolus’ Cave and the Trojan
          Horse examined above. The crucial difference with the failure of this
          final cavernous <em>moles</em> is the way that the destructive force within can
          also affect those who actively break open the structure to engage with
          it – even in the attempt to rid the world of such a chaos permanently.</p>
          
          <p>The Trojans sail on the Tiber to the Greek colony of Pallanteum and are
          received hospitably at a feast in which the dislocated Greeks under
          Evander are participating. After both peoples have taken in such
          festivities Evander tells Aeneas what exactly it is that they are
          celebrating: it is not some “empty superstition” (<em>uana superstitio</em>,
          <em>Aen</em>. 8.187) that established the ritual, he informs his Trojan guest,
          but rather the fact that his people were “saved from severe dangers”
          (<em>saevis…periclis</em> / <em>seruati</em>, 8.188-189). The Greek king then goes
          on to relate the story of how Hercules rescued them all from Cacus, a
          fire-breathing monster that had terrorized the region until the
          demigod’s arrival – all while pointing to the very place where the
          violent struggle happened. The following lines are the beginning of his
          description:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>iam primum saxis suspensam hanc aspice rupem,
          disiectae procul ut moles desertaque montis
          stat domus et scopuli ingentem traxere ruinam.
          hic spelunca fuit uasto summota recessu,
          semihominis Caci facies quam dira tenebat
          solis inaccessam radiis; semperque recenti
          caede tepebat humus, foribusque adfixa superbis
          ora uirum tristi pendebant pallida tabo.
          huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros
          ore uomens ignis magna se mole ferebat. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.190-199)</p>
          
            <p>Now first take a look at this cliff, rocky and overhanging, how
          <em>moles</em> have been scattered far and wide, how a deserted mountain home
          stands there, and how the boulders have drawn done a mighty collapse.
          Here set back in a vast recess was the cave that the terrible
          appearance of the half-man Cacus was possessing – a cave inaccessible
          to the rays of the sun. Always the ground was warm with recent
          slaughter, always fastened to his haughty doors were dangling the
          heads of men pale with grim gore. Vulcan was this monster’s father: it
          was <em>his</em> black fires that Cacus would vomit from his mouth while he
          was bearing the great mass of himself.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Here again is a “cave” (<em>spelunca</em>, 193).<sup id="fnref:291"><a href="#fn:291" class="footnote">59</a></sup> And once again it does
          not seem to be entirely natural. It has been “set back in a vast recess”
          from the mountain, Evander tells Aeneas, made into a “home” (<em>domus</em>)
          for Cacus (192-193). It is indeed another <em>moles</em> – albeit one that has
          been destroyed already (cf. <em>disiectae…moles</em>, 191) and is now lying
          in ruin. Vulcan is the father of this “half-human” (<em>semihominis</em>, 194),
          massive, fire-vomiting “monster” (<em>monstro</em>, 198). As the reader learns
          a little later, moreover, it was by the fire god’s own craftsmanship
          (<em>arte paterna</em>, 8.226) that the “cave” has a means of closing.<sup id="fnref:292"><a href="#fn:292" class="footnote">60</a></sup>
          Although it might then appear initially like a natural phenomenon,
          Cacus’ Cave is thus similar to the other “caves” examined above: it too
          serves as a constructed object that hides a force of pure destruction –
          of evil itself, in fact, as the monster’s name implies<sup id="fnref:293"><a href="#fn:293" class="footnote">61</a></sup> – which
          stands in the way of civilization and the attempt to establish
          order.<sup id="fnref:294"><a href="#fn:294" class="footnote">62</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>There is an important difference between this cavernous <em>moles</em> and the
          previous ones, however. Although Aeolus is not the builder of his cave,
          the king of the winds is in control of the chaos that lives within his
          cave – and he opens it under his own will. With the Trojan Horse,
          moreover, the Greeks who constructed it are the ones that break the seal
          and wreak their havoc upon the city (though Laocoon tried his best to
          reveal the <em>error</em> that lurked within the beast). In the case of Cacus’
          Cave, on the other hand, the evil is <em>unwillingly</em> exposed by Hercules,
          who not only breaks open the <em>moles</em> (and breaks it apart), but also
          enters it in order to confront the destructive force that lies hidden
          within.</p>
          
          <p>There are significant similarities, as one might expect, between how
          Hercules opens the cave and the way that both Aeolus breaks open his own
          one in Book 1 and Laocoon attempts to pierce the ones in Trojan Horse in
          Book 2, as the following passage makes clear:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hanc, ut prona iugo laeuum incumbebat ad amnem,
          dexter in aduersum nitens concussit et imis
          auulsam soluit radicibus, <strong>inde repente **
          **impulit; impulsu quo maximus intonat aether</strong>
          <strong>dissultant ripae refluitque exterritus amnis</strong>. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.236-240)</p>
          
            <p>Once [Hercules] had shaken this [stone] with all his effort from
          the right side, as it lay sloping along its ridge to the river on the
          left, and loosened it having ripped it up from its lowermost roots,
          <strong>he then suddenly struck it. The upper air thunders loudly at such a
          blow, the riverbanks jump back, and the river terrified reverses its
          course</strong>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Hercules through his great strength removes a giant stone so that he can
          gain access to the top of the cave in which Cacus has hid himself. In
          order to accomplish this, he had to “strike” (cf. <em>impulit</em>, 239) it
          with all his force – a strike that makes the upper air thunder and
          causes the river itself to reverse its course.<sup id="fnref:295"><a href="#fn:295" class="footnote">63</a></sup> It is significant
          that <em>impulit</em> is enjambed in the same position at the beginning of the
          line as when Vergil narrates how Aeolus “struck” his cave (cf. <em>Aen</em>.
          1.81-82). That is not the only similarity, though, which links the two
          events: both strikes result in thunderstorms (cf. <em>Aen</em>. 1.81-91); more
          than that, the blow is so great that it too disrupts the established
          order of things in making the river reverse its course (<em>refluitque
          exterritus amnis</em>, 240) – just as the winds had made what was on the
          bottom of the sea suddenly rise to the top.<sup id="fnref:296"><a href="#fn:296" class="footnote">64</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>Hercules thus opens the cave as Aeolus does and thereby succeeds where
          Laocoon failed. Yet there is still a price he must pay for breaking open
          this divinely-built structure and unleashing the chaotic forces within.
          Something happens to the hero upon his entry into the primordial chaos
          that the cave seeks to contain and hide: Hercules becomes very much like
          the monster that he is trying to vanquish.<sup id="fnref:297"><a href="#fn:297" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Cacus’ Cave is a dark
          place – not only because the rays of the sun cannot access it (cf.
          <em>solis inaccessam radiis</em>, 8.195), but also because of the “black fires”
          (<em>atros</em>…<em>ignis</em>, 8.199-200) which Cacus vomits from his mouth.<sup id="fnref:298"><a href="#fn:298" class="footnote">66</a></sup>
          And this darkness seems to envelop and penetrate Hercules himself as he
          fights against the monster in his lair:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>ille autem, neque enim fuga iam super ulla pericli,
          faucibus ingentem fumum (mirabile dictu)
          euomit inuoluitque domum caligine caeca
          prospectum eripiens oculis, glomeratque sub antra
          fumiferam noctem commixtis igne tenebris.
          non tulit Alcides animis seque ipse per ignem
          praecipiti iecit saltu, qua plurimus undam
          fumus agit nebulaque ingens specus aestuat atra. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.251-258)</p>
          
            <p>[Cacus], on the other hand, since there was now no more escape from
          danger, vomits forth a great cloud of smoke from his jaws (marvelous
          to say) and envelops his home with a blinding darkness, snatching
          sight from [Hercules’] eyes. He gathers in his cave a smoke-filled
          night with shadows mixed together with flame. Hercules did not endure
          this in his spirit and threw himself with a headlong jump through the
          fire, where the thickest smoke came in waves and the vast cavern
          seethed in a black cloud.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The fire which Cacus “vomits forth” (<em>evomit</em>, 253) envelops the cave in
          a “blinding darkness” (<em>caligne caeca</em>, 253). Much as the winds in Book
          1 which snatch away the sight from the eyes of the Trojans and bring
          about an untimely night (cf. <em>Aen</em>. 1.88-89), Cacus also takes the sight
          from Hercules’ eyes (<em>prospectum eripiens oculis</em>, 254) and manifests in
          his cave a “smoke-filled night” (<em>fumiferam noctem</em>, 255). None of this
          darkness deters Hercules, however, as the hero throws himself with a
          “headlong jump” (<em>preaecipiti</em>…<em>saltu</em>, 257) right into the middle of
          the flames and the shadows. Heroic as these actions may be, Vergil’s
          description (via Evander) of what happens next suggests that Hercules
          has lost control of himself as a result of his rage:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hic Cacum in tenebris incendia uana uomentem
          corripit in nodum complexus et angit inhaerens
          elisos ocules et siccum sanguine guttur.</p>
          
            <p>[…]</p>
          
            <p>…pedibusque informe cadauer
          protrahitur. nequeunt expleri corda tuendo
          terribilis oculos, uultum uillosaque saetis
          pectora semiferi atque exstinctos faucibus ignis. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.259-261,
          264-267)</p>
          
            <p>Wrapping him into a knot [Hercules] seizes Cacus vomiting vain fires
          in the shadows and gripping him tight he chokes him until his eyes
          popped out and his throat is dry with blood. […] The hideous
          cadaver is dragged out by the feet. Our hearts cannot get enough of
          seeing the terrible eyes of the beast, his face, his chest shaggy with
          hairs, and the fires from his jaws extinguished.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Although Cacus is a horrible monster, of course, and one that has
          terrorized humankind for many years (and has stolen Hercules’
          cattle),<sup id="fnref:299"><a href="#fn:299" class="footnote">67</a></sup> the way that the hero kills the beast in this passage is
          rather gruesome, perhaps even excessive, as he strangles the half-human
          being to the point that Cacus’ eyes pop out (<em>angit…elisos ocules</em>,
          260-261).<sup id="fnref:300"><a href="#fn:300" class="footnote">68</a></sup> Moreover, even while Evander and his people derive a
          twisted sort of pleasure from seeing Cacus’ dead body, the detail that
          Vergil gives to the scene – with the corpse being dragged out by his
          feet to be gawked at by the onlookers – has almost a twinge of sympathy.
          The poet had shown such sympathy before, after all, for another
          “monster” (<em>monstrum</em>, 3.658) back in Book 3: the blinded Polyphemus who
          can himself be seen as a model for Cacus with his own barbaric behavior
          in Book 9 of Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
          
          <p>This fire-breathing monster has been brought low. But at what cost? It
          is not too much to suggest – as several scholars have – that when the
          hero enters the darkness of the cave he loses control of himself and a
          sense of his own humanity.<sup id="fnref:301"><a href="#fn:301" class="footnote">69</a></sup> He would not be the first one in the
          poem to do this: Aeneas also enters a <em>spelunca</em> in book 4 and forgets
          himself and his mission, becoming <em>immemores</em> together with Dido.<sup id="fnref:302"><a href="#fn:302" class="footnote">70</a></sup>
          And the chaos that is unleashed from Aeolus’ <em>antrum</em> and the “caverns”
          within the Trojan Horse when they are opened should not be forgotten,
          either. Caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> represent a place where darkness and chaos
          dominate – a place where the repressed forces of chaos that overturn any
          attempt to establish order can find a “home” (<em>domus</em>, 8.192). When a
          hero enters such a cave (or tries to in the case of Laocoon) these
          forces are unleashed upon him – ending either with his destruction, as
          with Laocoon, or the breakdown of his very humanity, as seems to happen
          even to the heroic son of Jove.</p>
          
          <p>Cacus’ Cave is thus another case of “failed” architecture in the poem.
          Unlike in the previous two examples, however, it is not so much because
          the chaos inside breaks out. In the episode in Book 8 it is rather
          because the dark chaos of Rome’s past surrounds and temporarily traps
          the one who breaks open the structure in the attempt to destroy it. The
          result is a hero who becomes a monster while inside the construction –
          even if momentarily and for seemingly justifiable reasons. Even when one
          attempts to rid the world of these forces, in other words, it comes at a
          price, and with no certainty of any sort of lasting success.</p>
          
          <p>Hercules is perhaps not the only “hero” to undergo such a transformation
          in Book 8, however. The Cave of Cacus is built by his divine father
          Vulcan, but it is not the only (or the most famous) work of the divine
          craftsman in this book of the poem. The fire god also makes Aeneas’
          shield which is described at length by the poet towards the end of
          <em>Aeneid</em> 8.<sup id="fnref:303"><a href="#fn:303" class="footnote">71</a></sup> This shield tells a version of Roman history through
          the pictures on its surface, with one such image depicting Augustus
          himself:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hinc Augustus agens Italos in proelia Caesar
          cum patribus populoque, penatibus et magnis dis,
          stans celsa in puppi, geminas cui tempora flammas
          laeta uomunt patriumque aperitur uertice sidus. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.680-683)</p>
          
            <p>From this side Augustus Caesar leading Italians into battle together
          with the senate and the people, together with the household gods and
          the great gods, standing on his high ship, the sides of his head
          bounteously vomiting twin flames, and his father’s star appears on his
          top.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Augustus is depicted here as “vomiting” flames from the sides of his
          head (cf. <em>tempora flamma</em>…<em>vomunt</em>, 862-863).<sup id="fnref:304"><a href="#fn:304" class="footnote">72</a></sup> A reader might be
          reminded here of another figure in the book whose actions are also
          described with the verb <em>vomere</em>, namely, Cacus himself who is said to
          be doing so three separate times: <em>vomens</em> at 8.199, <em>evomit</em> at 8.253,
          and <em>vomentem</em> at 8.259.<sup id="fnref:305"><a href="#fn:305" class="footnote">73</a></sup> This section has demonstrated that
          Hercules becomes like the monster that he kills – even if it was to the
          benefit of the people of the proto-Rome – as he too “blazed with furies”
          (<em>furiis exarserat</em>, 219) in his battle with Cacus. Augustus has tamed
          his own monstrous <em>Furor</em>, namely, the one which dwells inside the
          Temple of Janus in Book 1. What did it cost him to confront and subdue
          this monster? What structures of Rome’s past did he have to destroy in
          that battle? And what does it do to those who try to tame the darkness
          and violence that disrupt any attempt to establish (or re-establish)
          order? Those are some of the questions that the episode surrounding
          Cacus’ Cave raises for anyone – whether a god or a man, whether an
          Aeneas or an Augustus – who tries to subjugate the destructive and
          violent chaos of Rome’s story that is bound only temporarily within the
          poem’s constructed caves.</p>
          
          <p>The three “caves” examined above present us with one type of “failed”
          architecture that attempts to impose structure on the chaotic forces of
          the past in Vergil’s poem. These <em>moles</em> are revealed to be unstable
          constructions: their boundaries fail to contain the chaotic fury of
          Rome’s past – a violent force that can upset the ordered structures of
          the cosmos, of the city, and even of one’s own humanity. The labyrinths
          in the poem represent another set of structures that attempt to contain
          and conceal such forces. In a similar way to the caves in the <em>Aeneid</em>,
          however, it is their “failure” to keep this chaos of the past at bay
          which the poem demonstrates for its readers.</p>
          
          <h3 id="part-2-labyrinths-of-meaning">Part 2. Labyrinths of Meaning</h3>
          
          <p>As difficult as it might be to escape from labyrinths – to find that one
          “right” way out – it is similarly no easy task to understand their
          symbolic value. Penelope Doob in her wide-ranging study on the idea of
          the labyrinth in Western literature speaks of a constant “double
          perspective” that one must consider when one is attempting to comprehend
          the meaning of these structures. Labyrinths are incredible feats of
          humankind – architectural masterpieces that elicited awe from those who
          saw or even read about them in antiquity.<sup id="fnref:306"><a href="#fn:306" class="footnote">74</a></sup> At the same time,
          however, labyrinths are also buildings that seem to lack a solid
          structure and organization to anyone who must enter and eventually
          escape them.<sup id="fnref:307"><a href="#fn:307" class="footnote">75</a></sup> As Doob puts it,</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>[w]hat you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the
          same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and
          double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity
          and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos.<sup id="fnref:308"><a href="#fn:308" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>For many modern (and post-modern) authors and architects, it is the
          latter of these two perspectives that has made the labyrinth a perfect
          symbol for their own struggles with meaning and language.<sup id="fnref:309"><a href="#fn:309" class="footnote">77</a></sup> Walter
          Benjamin thought of “the modern experience” as “labyrinthine.”<sup id="fnref:310"><a href="#fn:310" class="footnote">78</a></sup> And
          the architectural writer Carl Jencks defined as “Post-Modern” any space
          that “suspends the clear, final ordering of events for a labyrinthine,
          rambling ‘way’ that never reaches an absolute goal.”<sup id="fnref:311"><a href="#fn:311" class="footnote">79</a></sup> For the
          semiotician Umberto Eco, moreover, “the universe of semiosis can be
          postulated in the format of a labyrinth.”<sup id="fnref:312"><a href="#fn:312" class="footnote">80</a></sup> It is not, then, that
          labyrinths have no meaning or structure; it is rather that they might
          have too many meanings within a seemingly shifting structure. One might
          even go so far as Roland Barthes in discussing another great monument –
          the Eiffel Tower – to say that the labyrinth is similarly “impossible to
          escape, <em>because it means everything</em>.”<sup id="fnref:313"><a href="#fn:313" class="footnote">81</a></sup> Labyrinths are thus at
          once architectural wonders <em>and</em> structures that seem to defy the very
          idea of a stable architecture.<sup id="fnref:314"><a href="#fn:314" class="footnote">82</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>This double nature of architecture should already be somewhat familiar
          from the cavernous <em>moles</em> of the <em>Aeneid</em> examined in the previous part
          of this chapter. The labyrinths of the poem are likewise shown to
          present something on the surface that seems very stable and/or that
          delights while also “cracking open” to reveal darker, violent forces
          from the past that lie hidden beneath. With the labyrinth, however,
          there is a transition from the literal breakdown of boundaries to a more
          metaphorical collapse of the frame that allows the chaotic forces to
          escape. Although the figure of the labyrinth is a motif that has been
          demonstrated by scholars to run throughout the <em>Aeneid</em>,<sup id="fnref:315"><a href="#fn:315" class="footnote">83</a></sup> the focus
          of this section will be on the two times such structures are explicitly
          mentioned in close proximity, that is, near the end of Book 5 during the
          <em>Lusus Troiae</em> and at the beginning of Book 6 in the ecphrasis of
          Daedalus’ doors. In both instances, I argue below, these structures
          amaze their spectators and yet are instable and ultimately fail to
          contain the chaos of the past that they are built to conceal.</p>
          
          <h4 id="i-the-labyrinthine-lusus-troiae">(i) The Labyrinthine <em>Lusus Troiae</em></h4>
          
          <p>The first time that the poet mentions a labyrinth explicitly occurs in a
          simile comparing the mythical edifice to the intricate twists and turns
          of the mock-battle between the Trojan youths known as the <em>Lusus
          Troiae</em>:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta
          parietibus textum caecis iter ancipitemque
          mille uiis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi
          frangeret indeprensus et inremeabilis error:
          haud alio Teucrum nati uestigia cursu
          impediunt texuntque fugas et proelia ludo… (<em>Aen</em>. 5.589-594)</p>
          
            <p>As it is said that the labyrinth on high Crete once possessed a path
          woven amid blinding walls and a trick deceptive with its thousand
          turns, where <em>error</em> that was untraceable and unsolvable would break
          the signs to follow: in a not at all different course did the sons of
          the Trojans arrange their steps and weave retreats and battles in
          their play…</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The comparison here between the labyrinth and the games helps to
          illustrate the high level of intricacy and complexity of the boys’
          maneuvers.<sup id="fnref:316"><a href="#fn:316" class="footnote">84</a></sup> The Cretan labyrinth was a marvel, after all, and one
          that was highly praised in antiquity for just such a reason.<sup id="fnref:317"><a href="#fn:317" class="footnote">85</a></sup> Yet
          the association between the details of this building and the boys’
          spectacle might seem rather odd. The focus of the description is not so
          much on the labyrinth’s complexity as it is on the deceptive nature of
          the structure: its walls deprive one of sight (cf.
          <em>parietibus…caecis</em>, 590), and it contains a deceptive trick
          (<em>ancipitem…dolum</em>, 590-591) due to its many, winding paths; even more
          than that, though, the labyrinth is a place where one can see neither
          where one has gone nor where one should go, trapping one in a constant
          state of <em>error</em> – an <em>indeprensus et inremeablis error</em> (592).<sup id="fnref:318"><a href="#fn:318" class="footnote">86</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>The emphasis of Vergil’s simile is on the way that the labyrinth traps
          whoever enters it. That is surely not the quality which one would expect
          of a spectacle that is said to bring pleasure and a feeling of pride to
          its spectators. The poet has already told the reader that the Trojans
          “receive the timid [boys] with applause, rejoice at the sight of
          them…and recognize in them the faces of their old parents” (<em>excipiunt
          plausu pauidos gaudentque tuentes…ueterumque agnoscunt ora parentum</em>,
          <em>Aen</em>. 5.575-576). Let us think for a moment about this pleasure,
          though. It seems significant that the joy which the Trojans experience
          from watching the show comes from recognizing the past in the faces of
          their future. This is not, however, the past of Troy with which the
          readers of the poem are most familiar. The Troy that they have seen is
          merely a ruin, a place that was destroyed right before their eyes during
          Aeneas’ graphic narrative of the city’s sack in Book 2. It might seem
          therefore that <em>Lusus Troiae</em> is helping the Trojans on one level, at
          least, in the way that it allows them to forget about the recent
          disaster that befell their homeland and at the same time to remember
          events of Troy’s past that bring happiness to their hearts.</p>
          
          <p>If this is the case, though, why is there all the talk of deception in
          the simile that describes these same maneuvers? One way to answer this
          question, I would argue, is to suggest that the simile is emphasizing
          how the Trojans are “trapped” in a past they choose to remember,
          smoothing over the destruction of Troy that must still be paramount in
          their minds. The windings and twisting of the boys seem to be enough, in
          other words, to make the weary wanderers forget for a moment about the
          horrors that occurred at Troy and in the aftermath of its fall. The
          labyrinthine movements of the boys help to conceal a dark, chaotic time
          in the Trojans’ past – to frame it in an elaborate fiction that presents
          to the Trojans only what they want to remember.<sup id="fnref:319"><a href="#fn:319" class="footnote">87</a></sup> It is only able to
          accomplish this, however, for as long as the show lasts. The Trojan
          women bring that <em>furor</em> back into their minds soon enough by burning
          the ships while the Trojan men are watching this mesmerizing
          spectacle.<sup id="fnref:320"><a href="#fn:320" class="footnote">88</a></sup> The labyrinthine dance thus proves a rather costly
          distraction for the Trojans: its complex borders and frames cannot
          actually keep the chaos of the past at bay for very long.<sup id="fnref:321"><a href="#fn:321" class="footnote">89</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>It is not only the past that must enter into one’s understanding of this
          simile, but the future of Rome, as well. Soon after the simile that
          juxtaposes the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> to the Cretan Labyrinth (and before the
          Trojan women’s attack) the poet interrupts the narrative to discuss how
          this ritual would become very important to his own contemporary society:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hunc morem cursus atque haec certamina primus,
          Ascanius, Longam muris cum cingeret Albam,
          rettulit et priscos docuit celebrare Latinos,
          quo puer ipse modo, secum quo Troia pubes;
          Albani docuere suos; hinc maxima porro
          accepit Roma et patrium seruauit honorem;
          Troiaque nunc pueri, Troianum dicitur agmen. (<em>Aen</em>. 5.596-602)</p>
          
            <p>Ascanius was the first to bring back this kind of course and these
          games, when he was encircling Alba Long with walls, and taught the
          ancient Latins to celebrate them in the way that he as a boy had
          himself done, in the way that the Trojan youth had done with him. The
          Albans taught their own. From there greatest Rome later on received
          and kept the rite of their ancestors. Today the boys are called “Troy”
          and the column “Trojan.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Why does the poet choose this moment to make explicit the aetiology of
          the event?<sup id="fnref:322"><a href="#fn:322" class="footnote">90</a></sup> Although the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> probably first appeared as
          an event in Rome in the time of Sulla (and Caesar used it in his triumph
          in 46 BCE), it was Augustus who revived the “games” on a greater
          scale.<sup id="fnref:323"><a href="#fn:323" class="footnote">91</a></sup> The aetiology might then be a way, it has been suggested,
          of “complimenting Augustus by tracing the origin of the <em>lusus Troiae</em>
          to Aeneas and Ascanius.”<sup id="fnref:324"><a href="#fn:324" class="footnote">92</a></sup> However, the close proximity of this
          aetiology to the rather dark labyrinth simile might also lead a reader
          to understand this association in a less positive light.<sup id="fnref:325"><a href="#fn:325" class="footnote">93</a></sup> It might
          even be possible, for instance, to see the revival of the games as
          another attempt to give order to the chaos of a grim past of conflict –
          just as the games do for the Trojans who see them performed for the
          first time.<sup id="fnref:326"><a href="#fn:326" class="footnote">94</a></sup> Is the attempt successful? At first, yes, it is, as
          the boys repeat the past in such a way as to bring pleasure to the
          Trojans. Yet this repetition distracts the Trojans not only from the
          horrors of their past that still follow them but also from the fact that
          they have not yet reached the solid land of Italy; and while they enjoy
          the spectacle, the Trojan women try to destroy their fleet.</p>
          
          <p>The labyrinth that the boys weave with their maneuvers conceals the
          chaos of the past that eventually does not stay subdued within the
          boundaries of their art. If understood in this way the labyrinth is
          employed in this passage to suggest how a structure that almost defies
          structure can trap its beholder in a constructed past through its many
          turns. The figure of the labyrinth cannot be controlled so easily,
          however.<sup id="fnref:327"><a href="#fn:327" class="footnote">95</a></sup> While the labyrinth might make the Trojans feel free from
          the always present sense of chaos in their past, as well as the one in
          their uncertain future, the poem demonstrates how that very same
          architectural frame is unstable and ultimately “fails” to control that
          chaos permanently. A labyrinth aims to entrap those who enter its
          boundaries, distracting them with its complexity while simultaneously
          letting go something more sinister as the boundaries between inside and
          outside shift. And if a labyrinth – one of the great structures in the
          ancient world – cannot succeed in containing such a <em>furor</em>, what faith
          should one put in the Temple of Janus to keep at bay the <em>Furor</em> of
          Rome’s own recent past?</p>
          
          <h4 id="ii-the-labyrinthine-art-of-daedalus">(ii) The Labyrinthine Art of Daedalus</h4>
          
          <p>The labyrinthine spectacle of the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> alerts readers of the
          epic to the way that labyrinths can trap those who enter their winding,
          innumerable paths; in an even more nuanced way, though, Vergil’s
          narrative of the games also demonstrate how labyrinths can for a time at
          least keep certain aspects of the past hidden, imposing a highly complex
          artistic frame – a fiction of sorts – that conceals something that one
          might want to forget. At the same time, however, such “labyrinths” fail
          to impose a permanent, stable structure on the chaotic, destructive
          forces of the past that could break out of them at any moment. They can
          provide momentary relief from the horrors of the past, in other words,
          but they cannot keep them from repeating.</p>
          
          <p>The next labyrinth that the reader encounters in the poem shares many of
          these same characteristics. It is again not part of the narrative, <em>per
          se</em>, but a small piece of an ecphrasis that details the life and works
          of the great craftsman Daedalus on the doors which he designed for the
          temple of Apollo upon his arrival at Cumae.<sup id="fnref:328"><a href="#fn:328" class="footnote">96</a></sup> As with the labyrinth
          simile in Book 5, moreover, Daedalus’ labyrinth “fails” as a structure
          to keep hidden the monsters and <em>errores</em> of the past that it was
          designed to conceal; if anything, in fact, such chaos is shown <em>through</em>
          Daedalus’ own art to break out of the architectural structure that
          frames it and thereby to re-enter the present.</p>
          
          <p>After the ships are saved by Jupiter from the Trojan women’s fury Aeneas
          sails to Italy and finally makes landfall at Cumae at the start of Book
          6. He stops there in front of the doors of the temple of Apollo on his
          way to see the Sibyl to gaze at the reliefs carved upon them. This scene
          will be examined again in more detail in the following chapter that
          looks at the <em>monumenta</em> of the poem.<sup id="fnref:329"><a href="#fn:329" class="footnote">97</a></sup> For now, the focus will be
          on the labyrinth itself that is represented on the doors’ panels, as
          shown in the below passage:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
          Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
          Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
          hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.
          magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
          Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
          caeca regens filo uestigia. (<em>Aen</em>. 6.25-31)</p>
          
            <p>Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
          beneath [it] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
          the Minotaur, the <em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
          that toil of the house and the inescapable <em>error</em>. But indeed
          Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen’s great love unlocks the
          tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>The labyrinth was meant to conceal the Minotaur within its highly
          complex weaving of paths that the poet labels as <em>inextricabilis</em> (28),
          “from which one cannot find a way [out].”<sup id="fnref:330"><a href="#fn:330" class="footnote">98</a></sup> Yet this structure
          does not seem inescapable from the description of it here. Daedalus
          himself actually “opens up” the labyrinth by solving the very maze that
          he built to trap those who enter it (cf. <em>Daedalus ipse dolos tecti
          ambagesque resoluit</em>, / <em>caeca regens filo uestigia</em>, 30-31).<sup id="fnref:331"><a href="#fn:331" class="footnote">99</a></sup> Nor
          does the labyrinth depicted on the doors even hide the Minotaur: the
          beast – and the sinful affair it represents – is actually freed from the
          darkness of the labyrinth and displayed as on the doors for all to see.</p>
          
          <p>The architect can thus be said to break open his labyrinth: not only
          does he solve it in the myth itself; in a more unintentional way
          perhaps, he is also re-presenting to Aeneas (and the reader) the
          “failure” of his own construction to contain what was supposed to lie
          hidden by depicting the Minotaur on the doors and his own unlocking of
          the maze. Daedalus’ labyrinth is not just an example of “failed”
          architecture, therefore, but a <em>representation</em> of such failure.<sup id="fnref:332"><a href="#fn:332" class="footnote">100</a></sup>
          The master craftsman (as well as the poet describing his work) crascks
          open the labyrinth through his own art by revealing how to escape its
          twists and turns, its <em>errores</em>, as well as by depicting the monster
          that lies within them. In this way, then, the edifice might serve as a
          <em>mise en abyme</em> for the poem itself – a poem which I have argued also
          reveals the violent chaos of the past that exists within several
          structures meant to contain it.<sup id="fnref:333"><a href="#fn:333" class="footnote">101</a></sup></p>
          
          <p>But what effect does such a release have? In the narrative, at least, it
          might seem like the outcome is rather negligible: Aeneas simply marvels
          at such <em>spectacula</em> (6.37) before the Sibyl comes and diverts his
          attention to more urgent matters.<sup id="fnref:334"><a href="#fn:334" class="footnote">102</a></sup> As William Fitzgerald suggests,
          however, the passage allows the labyrinth in the <em>Aeneid</em> to emerge as</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>a complex symbol of the status of the past. It is both a highly
          elaborate artistic work that freezes the past in a harmlessly
          discontinuous relation with the present and, as an instigator of
          repetition that transforms pattern into path, it offers the
          possibility of reactivating that past and assimilating it into the
          flow of history.<sup id="fnref:335"><a href="#fn:335" class="footnote">103</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Fitzgerald may be right to claim that labyrinths offer the “possibility”
          of bringing the past into a structured frame. It is only a possibility,
          though, and the results are only provisional at best, as additional
          analysis of this passage in the next chapter will reveal. By
          representing the monsters of Rome’s violent past can the <em>Aeneid</em>
          provide a frame for containing them? Or does it run the risk of
          revealing and releasing what would rather be forgotten? Once again, the
          question arises of whether architectural structures – even architecture
          as intricate as that of a labyrinth – can really provide a permanent,
          stable frame that prevents the <em>furor</em> of Rome’s past from breaking free
          of its bounds.</p>
          
          <p>This chapter has demonstrated that grand constructions such as cavernous
          <em>moles</em> and intricate labyrinths offer only the illusion of creating a
          frame that can contain the past within a stable narrative. The following
          chapter will show how the boundaries of monuments in the <em>Aeneid</em> also
          appear to be ineffectual in containing the chaos of the past that they
          represent within their artistic frames. As with the labyrinths examined
          above, moreover, the failure of the poem’s <em>monumenta</em> is not so much in
          the collapse of their physical boundaries as it is in a breakdown of
          their epistemological borders – which results in the release of the
          <em>errores</em> of the past so that they can repeat in the present. The same
          can be said for the <em>Aeneid</em> itself and its epic architexture as
          symbolized in magnificent Baldric of Pallas, whose resplendent frame is
          unable to keep the <em>furor</em> in Rome’s past at bay.</p>
          
          <p>The poem does not show the “cracks” in its epic architexture to a wholly
          negative end, however. The failure of its architexture to provide a
          stable structure that can conceal and contain permanently the chaos it
          holds within it demonstrates at the same time the need to be aware of
          the fury that exists behind a monumental facade. For it is by being able
          to read beneath what one sees on the surface, I will argue, that the
          <em>Aeneid</em> shows how one can best prepare for – and perhaps even prevent –
          such a collapse of structure from occurring in the first place.</p>

                <p>This interest in the interior space of architecture is perhaps
          characteristically Roman – in part, at least, because of the Romans’
          ability to create much more dynamic spaces with the invention of
          concrete construction in the latter half of 2<sup>nd</sup> Century BCE. For
          the importance of this innovation for architecture, see Ling 1988,
          1672-1689, arguing that the ability to shape interior space through
          concrete was “Rome’s great legacy to posterity.” As Ward-Perkins
          1981 [1994], 101, points out, in fact, “[a]lready…in the Roman
          architecture of the Late Republic one can detect a growing awareness
          of the properties of interior space.” For a modern perspective of
          this issue, see also Wright 1928, 148-149, where the famous modern
          architect discusses Greek architecture as “a mere matter of
          constructing decoration” that led to a building that could be seen
          as “a block of building material…from the outside” with no attention
          to what existed within. The Romans adopted the architecture of the
          Greeks, of course, but with an attention to interior spaces that was
          previously less significant. In a way similar to much modern
          architecture in Wright’s estimation, Vergil’s <em>monumentum</em> of a text
          also seeks for “exterior expression” (149), that is, to give a voice
          to what a monument’s facade might conceal. <a href="#fnref:238" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          focuses upon the idea that “the poem is very interested in the flux
          which always makes it hard to impose [a] fixed pattern” of
          interpretation on the past, as well as that of the future. See also
          Johnson 1976, 133, asserting that “Vergil’s subject is, in large
          measure, how men and nations behaved in the past, how they tend now
          to behave, and why. […] [T]he longer Vergil pondered his
          contents and design, the more his poem came to be about the nature
          of history.” I will argue that it is in its nuanced treatment of
          architecture – the very thing that makes history possible in the

                <p>My reading of architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em> as “failing” to
          maintain its boundaries is influenced by Bartsch 1998. In this
          article on the ecphraseis of the poem Bartsch remarks on several of
          the same objects that I analyze in the current chapter, as well as
          in the next one (e.g., the Trojan horse, the Doors of Daedalus,
          Pallas’ Baldric). Bartsch likewise notes the problem with the
          boundaries of art to contain violent and chaotic forces that disrupt
          meaning and upset the established order of things, claiming that
          “the artworks of the <em>Aeneid</em> participate in this economy of values
          that sets control and containment against the consequences of an
          impassioned violence. This attribute of the Virgilian artwork is
          counterbalanced, however, by its repeated failure to fulfill such a
          task: unable to restrain violence, the artwork literally lets it
          spill out, like a troop of murderous Greek warriors issuing from the
          carved cavity of a wooden horse’s womb” (322). My focus is not only
          on artworks, but on architectural structures, in particular, and how
          they influence the way that we understand Vergil’s epic architexture
          as part of the broader monumental discourse of the Augustan age. <a href="#fnref:246" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>This is not the first time in the poem that the reader has come
          across the word <em>moles</em>. Nor is it the last, as we will see
          throughout the first part of this chapter. In the famous line that
          ends the proem of the <em>Aeneid</em>, for instance, Vergil asks the
          question: “Was it of such a great effort (<em>molis</em>) to found
          (<em>condere</em>) the Roman race?” (<em>tantae molis erat Romanum condere
          erat</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.33). Although the word obviously has a different
          meaning here, the operative metaphor is architectural with <em>condere</em>
          – used just a few lines earlier to describe Aeneas’ task of founding
          a city in Italy (<em>multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem /
          inferretque deos Latio</em>, 1.5-6). And this “effort” is not just that
          of Aeneas, but it is the task of Vergil, as well, as he begins to
          construct his own massive epic poem on that difficult topic. To find
          the word again so soon afterwards, not more than thirty lines,
          suggests an indirect connection between (a poem on) founding Rome
          and the construction of Aeolus’ Cave – which makes the latter’s
          subsequent “failure” all the more ominous. On the parallel nature of

          of the Trojan Horse and Aeolus’ Cave (and that of Cacus, as well)
          touches upon many of the same passages as the current analysis. His
          point is to show that Vergil is using similar imagery to emphasize
          the “all-encompassing motif of…violence suppressed and then coming
          to the surface” which is central to the poem in Putnam’s analysis
          (26). My focus is not on violence, <em>per</em> se, but the interaction

                <p>This transformation is anticipated by the poet in the way that
          he (via Evander) uses fire imagery to describe Hercules’ wrath even
          before the hero even enters the cave. At 8.219-220, for instance,
          Hercules’ pain blazes with black gall (cf. <em>Alcidae furiis exarserat
          atro</em> / <em>felle dolor</em>); at line 230, moreover, he is described as
          “blazing with anger” (<em>fervidus ira</em>) because he cannot find a way
          into the cave. Even before his battle with the monster, then, it is
          possible to detect a monstrous change in the hero himself. For more
          discussion of the transformation Hercules undergoes in fighting
          Cacus see also: Doob 1990, 241, where she claims that although
          Hercules serves “a model for Aeneas” in certain respects, the hero’s
          rage “is also a warning” to not “become the monster you destroy”;
          Putnam 1998, 161-162, arguing that “Virgil’s text both confirms the
          similarity [between Hercules and Aeneas/Augustus] and complicates
          it by drawing a series of verbal parallels between Hercules and
          Cacus”; and Henry 1989, 170-171, with the suggestion that “[t]he
          strength as well as the brutality of Cacus is repeatedly emphasized
          as Virgil prepares the reader for Hercules’ merciless wrath (VIII.
          194-212). […] It is because he must move so close to all these
          threatening nonhuman forces that Hercules runs so fearful a risk of
          madness.” It is important to keep in mind – as Heinze 1903 [1915],
          485, n.1, notes – that it was on Vergil’s own initiative that he
          expanded upon the myth and made the battle a “<em>dramatisch bewegte

                <p>P. A. Miller 1995 also sees the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> as a “strategy of
          containment.” However, Miller’s reading of the labyrinth presents it
          as “symbolic” (in the Lacanian sense) of “the attempt to domesticate
          the chaotic powers associated with passion and the feminine” (228).
          Indeed, for Miller, “[t]he labyrinth as the symbolic functions as
          a mechanism of repression, which makes a controlled, socially
          sanctioned desire possible” (234) and represents “those patriarchal
          strategies of containment that try to shut out the other, both from
          within and without” (240). See also Habinek 2005, 254-256, where he
          picks up on the symbolic nature of the labyrinth as “feminine,” in
          that “[t]he knowledge acquired by the journey into and return from
          the labyrinth…is also knowledge of the innards of the body, whether
          construed as entrails or female sexual organs or both.” (254). It is
          interesting to note in the context of this passage, moreover, that
          the idea of the labyrinth as “imposing order on chaos” might be a
          particularly Roman idea. See McEwan 1993, 60, who argues that
          “[t]he Western tradition has been to interpret the skillful
          embrace of <em>aporia</em> revealed through the construction of…[the]

                <p>Fitzgerald 1984, 55, argues suggestively that the “temple frieze
          <em>is</em> a labyrinth” – one “whose balanced symmetry baffles the eye
          that would trace a narrative line through its contents.” <a href="#fnref:332" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>See Bartsch, 1998, 328, maintaining that the <em>Aeneid</em> uses the
          labyrinth (and other “labyrinthine artworks”) as a symbol for the
          complexity of its own meaning. <a href="#fnref:333" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <p>Cf. <em>Aen</em>. 6.33-37: “He would have no doubt scanned all of it
          with his eyes had not Achates, who was already sent ahead, then
          arrived and with him the priestess of Apollo and Diana, Diephobe,
          daughter of Glaucus, who said the following to the king: ‘This time
          does not lend itself to such spectacles.’” (<em>quin protinus omnia</em> /
          <em>perlegerent oculis, ni iam praemissus Achates</em> / <em>adforet atque una
          Phoebi Triuiaeque sacerdos, </em>/ <em>Deiphobe Glauci, fatur quae talia
          regi:</em> / <em>‘non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula poscit</em>’). See also
          Henry 1989, 141-142, for the “particular importance” these events
          might have had for Aeneas, and Casali 1995, 1-9, for a speculative
          hypothesis regarding what Aeneas might have seen if he had continued
          to examine the doors. <a href="#fnref:334" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
