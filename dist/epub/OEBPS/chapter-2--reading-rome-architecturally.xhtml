    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>Two bronze columns were placed in front of Augustus&#x2019; Mausoleum at Rome
      after the death of the <em>princeps</em> in 14 CE. These columns were inscribed
      with a text describing the &#x201C;<em>Res Gestae</em> of the Divine Augustus&#x201D;
      (<em>RGDA</em>).<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The prose of the inscription was relatively &#x201C;simple&#x201D; and
      full of officialese phrases that some scholars would suggest provide
      very little insight into how Augustus actually viewed his
      achievements.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Others see the text as &#x201C;a complex and allusive
      document, addressed to many audiences and with many levels of
      meaning.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">3</a></sup> No matter what way one decides to read the <em>Res Gestae</em>,
      though, it still represents perhaps the most definitive statement that
      exists of how Augustus framed his work at Rome for posterity.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">4</a></sup> It is
      truly a monument both of and to the Augustan age.</p>
      
      <p>This dissertation argues that the <em>Res Gestae</em> is also a text whose
      monumentality needs be understood within the context of other literary
      monuments of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The <em>RGDA</em> demonstrates how Augustus
      used architecture &#x2013; as much in his language as in the landscape of the
      city &#x2013; to redefine the way his subjects would see their restored <em>res
      publica</em> on a continuum from Rome&#x2019;s humble beginnings to its &#x201C;collapse&#x201D;
      at the end of the republic and finally to its monumental transformation
      under Augustus.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">6</a></sup> But this monumentalization of Rome in the Roman
      imagination was by no means the project of the <em>princeps</em> alone. Horace,
      Vergil, and Ovid each added &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; of their own which would
      anticipate the different ways in the <em>Res Gestae</em> that Augustus himself
      would articulate his reconstruction of Rome &#x2013; both as a city and as an
      idea. Subsequent chapters will look in particular at how these three
      poets of the Augustan age both critiqued and contributed to a
      metaphorical transformation of Rome from crumbling brick to monumental
      marble in the Roman imagination as much as in its physical reality.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>To examine this shared project of the <em>princeps</em> and the Augustan poets
      it will first be necessary to understand how each of them negotiated his
      position from within the Roman tradition of viewing their world
      architecturally. The current chapter will outline some aspects of this
      tradition by briefly analyzing a few of the ways that architecture
      helped to determine how the Romans structured their reality
      conceptually.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">8</a></sup> I will begin in Part 1 by analyzing the fundamental
      link between architecture and order (political and otherwise) in
      Vitruvius&#x2019; <em>De architectura</em>. Part 2 will then look at architecture&#x2019;s
      essential role in the Roman &#x201C;art of memory&#x201D; (<em>ars memoriae</em>). In Part 3
      the ideas of the preceding two sections will be applied to exploring the
      concept of Roman monumentality, with particular attention to how
      &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; (<em>monumenta</em>) provided an opportunity for Romans both to
      remember their past and critically examine how it fit within their
      present. This survey will end by then turning in Parts 4 and 5 to how
      two Romans &#x2013; the historian Livy and Augustus himself &#x2013; used a common
      language of monumental architecture at the beginning of their respective
      texts to represent the work they did to help &#x201C;rebuild&#x201D; Rome after the
      supposed &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; of both the <em>res publica</em> and the <em>mores</em> upon which
      it was founded.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This survey is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of the
      role of architecture in the Roman imagination. Several of the topics and
      texts touched upon here have been the subjects of much more thorough
      studies. My purpose in this chapter is rather to build upon the work of
      other scholars in order to provide a framework through which we might
      contextualize how Augustan age poets fashioned their poetic <em>monumenta</em>
      as contributions to the monumentalization of Rome. The point will be to
      establish the historical and literary milieu in which to examine why
      these poets fashioned their works as &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; in the first place, as
      well as to consider how we might understand Augustus&#x2019; collective work in
      Rome as an architectural <em>monumentum</em> in its own right.</p>
      
      <p>Later chapters will demonstrate how Augustus used architecture in his
      <em>Res Gestae</em> to redefine the traditional boundaries between past and
      present, between private and public, as well as those between Rome as a
      republic and Rome as his empire. He fashioned the city itself as a kind
      of &#x201C;memory store,&#x201D; I argue, one which all of its citizens could
      experience and use to define what it meant to be Roman in the Augustan
      age. The <em>princeps</em> did not just add new monuments to the city, in other
      words, but rather made Rome itself a monument, as he took what was a
      city of brick and left it one of marble.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">10</a></sup> The poets of this period
      used the idea of the monument, too, as a means of expanding, dissolving,
      and reconstituting the boundaries of their own poetry. This was not just
      in response to what Augustus was doing; the poets were actively in
      dialogue with Augustus&#x2019; monumentalization of the city, rather, and in
      such a way that their readers could then also better appreciate and
      evaluate what was happening to their Rome.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">11</a></sup> It is one of the main
      contentions of this dissertation, in fact, that we can better account
      for Augustus&#x2019; successful monumentalization of Rome by examining in
      parallel the &#x201C;architexture&#x201D; that several contemporary poets built in
      fashioning their works of literature as &#x201C;monuments,&#x201D; too.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">12</a></sup> And the
      purpose of this chapter is to show why it was monumental discourse in
      particular that served as the language through which Augustus and the
      poets of his age imagined their works.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-1-architecturally-speaking-the-imagery-of-vitruvius-de-architectura">Part 1. Architecturally Speaking: The Imagery of Vitruvius&#x2019; <em>De Architectura</em></h3>
      
      <p>Perhaps the most suitable place to start exploring the role that
      architecture played in how Romans structured the world around them
      conceptually would be with the only architectural treatise that survives
      intact from antiquity, namely, Vitruvius&#x2019; <em>De architectura</em>. The
      language that this late 1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE architect employed provides a
      useful window into the intersection of architectural and political
      discourse in the Roman imagination. It would seem that for Vitruvius the
      state could in a sense not exist without its architecture &#x2013; whether in
      physical fact, or in even the language one uses to describe it.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">13</a></sup> It
      is through this discourse of monumental architecture that the architect
      made sense of what Augustus had done to the <em>res publica</em>&#x2019;s physical and
      metaphorical foundations. And it should not be surprising, then, to find
      that Vitruvius&#x2019; language anticipates to a certain degree the <em>princeps</em>&#x2019;
      own account of this transformation in the <em>Res Gestae</em> that will be
      examined at the end of this chapter, as well as throughout the rest of
      this dissertation.</p>
      
      <p>There is no passage in the treatise that better illustrates the
      architectural nature of this transformation than the preface addressed
      to Augustus himself. Vitruvius was quite aware of what the <em>princeps</em>
      had been doing to the physical appearance of Rome by the mid-20s BCE; in
      fact, that is why the architect claims to have written his treatise in
      the first place:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>cum uero adtenderem te non solum de uita communi omnium curam
      publicaeque rei <strong>constitutione</strong> habere, sed etiam de opportunitate
      publicorum aedificiorum ut civitas per te non solum prouinciis <strong>esset
      aucta</strong>, uerum etiam ut maiestas imperii publicorum aedificiorum
      egregias haberet auctoritates, non putaui praetermittendum quin primo
      quoque tempore de his rebus ea tibi ederem&#x2026; (Vitr. Pr.2)<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>When indeed I noticed the concern you had not only for the common life
      of all and the <strong>structure</strong> of the state but also concerning the
      opportunity for public buildings, so that the state would not simply
      <strong>be made greater</strong> by the acquisition of provinces, but that the
      majesty of the empire might also have the illustrious authority of
      public buildings, I thought I should not let pass the right
      opportunity to publish the following on these topics for you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In the same preface Vitruvius adds that he has dedicated his treatise to
      Augustus because of what the <em>princeps</em> had done, was doing, and would
      do to the architectural landscape of Rome. &#x201C;I began to write this for
      you,&#x201D; the architect tells Augustus,</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>quod animaduerti multa te aedificauisse et nunc aedificare, reliquo
      quoque tempore et publicorum et priuatorum aedificiorum, <strong>pro
      amplitudine</strong> rerum gestarum ut posteris <strong>memoriae</strong> traderentur
      curam habiturum&#x2026; (Vitr. Pr.3)</p>
      
        <p>since I noticed that you had built and continue to build much, and
      that you would in your remaining time take care of both public and
      private buildings so that <strong>memorials</strong> would be passed down to
      posterity <strong>proportional to the size</strong> of your achievements&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>These two passages demonstrate the importance that Vitruvius believes
      Augustus attributed to architecture in Rome. In the first one, the
      architect relates that the <em>princeps</em> erected buildings which had
      &#x201C;illustrious authority&#x201D; (<em>egregias&#x2026;auctoritates</em>) in order to ennoble
      the state &#x2013; even on the same level as the acquisition of new
      territories. In the second, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that both
      public and private buildings could serve as memorials (<em>memoriae</em>) to
      the greatness of Augustus himself in the sense that they would reflect
      the magnitude (<em>amplitudo</em>) of his military and political achievements.
      As Kristina Milnor suggests, Vitruvius&#x2019; point here is &#x201C;not simply that
      [Augustus] has built more, better, and bigger&#x2026;but rather that he has
      revealed the ways in which architecture can mean something more than the
      construction of buildings.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>That is not the point of my analysis, however. What interests me in
      these passages is how the architectural <em>language</em> in them configures
      (and reconfigures) the relationship between architecture and the
      metaphorical structure of the Roman state. In the first passage,
      Vitruvius neatly parallels the &#x201C;structure of the state&#x201D; (<em>publicae rei
      constitutio</em>) with its public architecture (<em>publica aedificia</em>) through
      a <em>non solum&#x2026;sed etiam</em> construction. Through the <em>ut</em>-clause expressing
      effort, moreover, Vitruvius suggests that the reason Augustus has been
      taking such good care of Rome&#x2019;s metaphorical and physical <em>constitutio</em>
      is that the <em>princeps</em> himself is aware that the grandeur of the <em>res
      publica</em>&#x2019;s physical appearance can affect and indeed amplify the majesty
      of its metaphorical greatness.</p>
      
      <p>The use of architectural metaphors for the state in republican Roman
      literature is not new, of course, as we will see below. What is striking
      here is how by the end of the second passage it would seem that those
      same sorts of architectural metaphors &#x2013; and, in particular, the one
      regarding &#x201C;size&#x201D; &#x2013; have come to represent something other than &#x201C;the
      structure&#x201D; of the republican state. In the first passage, it is the
      majesty of the state that can be metaphorically increased in size by
      Augustus&#x2019; deeds at home and abroad. In the second, however, the actual
      buildings of Augustus&#x2019; reign, both private and public, suddenly become
      <em>memoriae</em> for a new kind of metaphorical &#x201C;structure&#x201D; to be handed down
      to posterity. The sense of greatness that these new buildings evoke
      through their magnificent appearance is now proportional to the great
      &#x201C;size&#x201D; of Augustus&#x2019; own &#x201C;accomplishments&#x201D; (<em>pro amplitudine rerum
      gestarum</em>) &#x2013; and no longer the greatness of state, as it was in the
      earlier passage.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The architectural language that Vitruvius employs thus allows the
      architect to stress the stability and structure that the <em>princeps</em> has
      restored to the Roman world &#x2013; something architectural metaphors do quite
      well in general<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">17</a></sup> &#x2013; while at the same time suggesting that a
      transformation has occurred between the old &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of the state and
      the new one under Augustus. In short, the <em>princeps</em> might be taking
      care of the &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of the <em>res publica</em>; by the end of the preface,
      however, that <em>constitutio</em> has been transformed from the old republican
      one to one of Augustus&#x2019; own construction that signifies <em>his</em> greatness,
      and no longer just the state&#x2019;s.</p>

      <p>Vitruvius was an architect, of course, and he was writing about
      architecture. It should be noted, though, that seeing the state as a
      building was not uncommon in the context in which Vitruvius was
      building, writing, and thinking. At the very origins of Latin
      literature, for example, there is a fragment from the epic <em>Annales</em> of
      Ennius &#x2013; famous already in antiquity, as quoted by Cicero at the start
      of Book V of the <em>De re publica</em> &#x2013; which proclaims that &#x201C;the Roman state
      is founded upon (<em>stat</em>) its <em>mores</em> and men of old.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Rome the city
      and Rome the institution went together to such an extent that the
      permanence and stability of its material buildings could even represent
      the structure and stability of the state itself, as Cicero is so eager
      to suggest of his own house in his <em>De domo sua</em>.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">19</a></sup> According to
      Alexander Demandt, in fact, &#x201C;the stability of the masonry, the symmetry
      of the overall system, the subordination of all individual forms to the
      overall plan make the traits of the Roman political system
      architecturally visible.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">20</a></sup> That is not to say that Vitruvius should
      necessarily be taken as wholly representative of how all Romans
      <em>consciously</em> thought about the structure of their state (if such a
      thing is even possible to determine). What I would like to suggest is
      rather that we understand the architect&#x2019;s work as a more explicit
      articulation of a deep connection that underlies the way that Romans saw
      the world around them &#x2013; a connection not just between the physical and
      metaphorical idea of the Roman state, but more broadly between the idea
      of architecture and structure itself.</p>
      
      <p>A sequence of passages from the beginning of Book 2 of the <em>De
      architectura</em> will help to flesh out this connection further. According
      to Vitruvius, at least, the relationship between the architectural and
      political spheres starts at the very beginnings of civilization. It was
      the discovery of fire, Vitruvius tells us, which led to the near
      simultaneous invention of architecture, political associations, and even
      language:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>In eo hominum congressu cum profundebantur alitae e spiritu voces,
      cotidiana consuetudine <strong>uocabula</strong> ut optigerant <strong>constituerunt</strong>,
      deinde significando res saepius in usu ex eventu fari fortuito
      coeperunt, et ita sermones inter se procreauerunt. [&#x2026;] Ergo cum
      propter ignis inuentionem conuentus initio apud homines et concilium
      et conuictus esset natus&#x2026;coeperunt in eo coetu alii de fronde facere
      tecta, alii speluncas fodere sub montibus, nonnulli hirundinum nidos
      et aedificationes earum imitantes de luto et uirgulis facere loca quae
      subirent. (Vitr. 2.1.1-2)</p>
      
        <p>In this gathering of people when voices were being poured forth
      supported by breath, <strong>they established words</strong>, as it so happened,
      from daily habit. They began then by chance in this way to speak more
      and more, signifying different objects from habit, and thus invented
      speech among themselves. [&#x2026;] Therefore when from the invention of
      fire the first meeting, assembly, and political association among
      humankind was born&#x2026;from this gathering some began to make houses of
      leaves, others to hollow out caves under mountains, and some in the
      imitation of nests and constructions of swallows began to fashion from
      mud and twigs places where they could dwell.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This passage is famous for how Vitruvius tells of the origins of
      architecture in such a way that it &#x201C;becomes embedded with the memory of
      primary human symbols, especially of fire and of the hearth, and of
      shelter.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">21</a></sup> As before, however, the focus of this current study is on
      the architect&#x2019;s language. And it is notable that just as humans start
      building physical structures, they are also said to be &#x201C;building&#x201D;
      language (cf. <em>uocabula&#x2026;constituerunt</em>) &#x2013; and with it the very
      foundations of society.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">22</a></sup> It makes sense, then, that Vitruvius&#x2019;
      language itself suggests a correlation between political associations
      and their architecture: without architecture, there would be no language
      and no civilization.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">23</a></sup> &#x201C;In other matters, and especially in
      architecture,&#x201D; Vitruvius claims, &#x201C;there are these two components: that
      which is signified and that which signifies.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">24</a></sup> In Roman
      architecture, for Vitruvius, it is not just the state that is signified
      by architectural structures, but the idea of order itself &#x2013; whether
      physical, political, or perhaps even linguistic.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Only a few paragraphs later in Book 2 of the <em>De architectura</em> the
      reader comes to a passage that confirms more concretely the deep
      connection between architecture and the Roman state in particular:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>apud ceteras quoque gentes et nonnulla loca pari simulique ratione
      casarum perficiuntur <strong>constitutiones</strong>. Non minus etiam Massiliae
      animaduertere possumus sine tegulis subacta cum paleis terra tecta.
      Athenis Areopagi antiquitatis exemplar ad hoc tempus luto tectum. Item
      in Capitolio commonefacere potest et significare <strong>mores</strong> uetustatis
      Romuli casa et in arce sacrorum stramentis tecta. (Vitr. 2.1.5)</p>
      
        <p>Among other peoples and in certain places, as well, the <strong>structures</strong>
      of houses are fashioned in a like and similar way. No less can we pass
      over the roofs at Marseilles which are made without tiles but with
      earth joined with straw. The Areopagus at Athens &#x2013; still an example of
      antiquity &#x2013; is roofed with clay. In the same way Romulus&#x2019; hut covered
      with straw on the Capitoline is able to call to mind and signify the
      <strong><em>mores</em></strong> of antiquity. The same can be said of the roofs of the
      temples on the citadel.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In the immediately preceding sentences Vitruvius is merely discussing
      how peoples in different places build their houses with the materials
      available to them. However, as the architect continues to list the
      varieties of materials necessary for the various kinds of
      <em>constitutiones</em>, his language starts to slip between describing the
      physical structures that remain and the <em>mores</em> (&#x201C;behavior/customs&#x201D;) of
      the people who built them. This transition starts perhaps with a mention
      of the Areopagus in Athens, which still exists as &#x201C;an example of
      antiquity,&#x201D; but becomes more pronounced in the discussion of Romulus&#x2019;
      hut. &#x201C;The image here is of a primitive hut,&#x201D; of course, but as Idris
      McEwan rightly suggests in her reading of the passage, &#x201C;primitive
      construction methods are not its signified matter.&#x201D; It is such a basic
      assumption for Vitruvius that the <em>constitutiones</em> of old buildings
      represent the early &#x201C;foundations&#x201D; of the state &#x2013; the <em>mores</em> upon which
      it stands, as Ennius and Cicero put it &#x2013; that he easily transitions from
      talking about roof-making in Marseilles to the famous Areopagus of
      Athens to Romulus&#x2019; hut in Rome together with the <em>mores</em> that it
      represents.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This all appears to be very natural for Vitruvius, though. In his mind,
      at least, architecture and political structures (together with the
      language to describe them both) have been closely bound from the very
      start of human civilization. And it is by practicing architecture, he
      goes on to claim in the very next paragraph, that humankind not only
      discovered &#x201C;other arts and disciplines,&#x201D; but also advanced &#x201C;from a wild
      and savage life to civilized society.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">27</a></sup> It is by <em>doing</em>
      architecture, in other words, that people began to understand and
      conceptualize other &#x201C;structures&#x201D; &#x2013; scientific as well as political.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">28</a></sup>
      It is not hard in that case to see why architecture and architectural
      language are such important parts of how Vitruvius articulates what he
      sees happening to the landscape of Rome under Augustus both physically
      and metaphorically. In short, the idea of &#x201C;structure&#x201D; &#x2013; be it political
      or otherwise &#x2013; is by its very nature architectural for Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>If we return to Vitruvius&#x2019;s preface it is perhaps possible to see more
      clearly now why he is so prone to employ architectural imagery to
      communicate the changes that Augustus made to the <em>res publica</em> through
      his public and private buildings. Since systems are inherently
      architectural for Vitruvius, it makes sense that the architect uses
      architectural imagery to convey the change in Rome&#x2019;s system of
      government &#x2013; that is, its structure, or in Latin, its <em>consitutio</em>.</p>
      
      <p>Did all Romans consciously see such a deep connection between
      architecture and the imaginative systems by which they ordered their
      existence? It is not possible to determine that with any certainty. And
      we should be cautious about applying the <em>specifics</em> of Vitruvius&#x2019; views
      as an architect to what other Romans, including Augustus, may have
      consciously thought about architecture&#x2019;s power as a metaphor for the way
      they conceived the world around them. There is fortunately other
      evidence, however, that suggests how architecture may have been an
      essential component in the way that Romans gave order and meaning to
      their lives and thoughts. The famous &#x201C;art of memory&#x201D; (<em>ars memoriae</em>)
      that Roman orators employed required its users, as the next section will
      demonstrate, to create architectural settings in their minds for the
      purpose of structuring their own thoughts, as well as the thoughts of
      their audiences.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-2-the-architecture-of-the-roman-ars-memoriae">Part 2. The Architecture of the Roman <em>Ars Memoriae</em></h3>
      
      <p>In Book 2 of the <em>De oratore</em> Cicero writes about how the Greek poet
      Simonides invented the so-called &#x201C;art of memory.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">30</a></sup> And the
      particular origin story that Cicero describes is relevant to this
      current study for the role that architecture plays in it. The poet is
      said to have been dining with one of his patrons, Scopas, when he was
      called outside to meet with a pair of youths. As soon as he left,
      though, the room (<em>conclave</em>) in which they were dining collapsed upon
      Scopas and his companions. But when the friends of the dead wished to
      bury their comrades it was Simonides who was able to help identify each
      of the corpses because he knew the place in which each of them had sat
      by remembering the setting itself.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">31</a></sup> It was because of this, Cicero
      writes, that the poet &#x201C;is reported to have discovered that it is order
      most of all that gives clarity to memory&#x201D; (<em>invenisse fertur ordinem
      esse maxime, qui memoriae lumen adferret</em>, Cic. <em>De or.</em> 2.353).
      Simonides thus came to the conclusion that one could create places in
      the mind to set the ideas one wanted to remember. In this way, then,</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>ut ordinem rerum locorum ordo conservaret, res autem ipsas rerum
      effigies notaret atque ut locis pro cera, simulacris pro litteris
      uteremur. (Cic. <em>De or</em>. 2.354)</p>
      
        <p>while the order of places would keep the order of things, the symbol
      of the things would denote the things themselves, and we would use the
      places as we would wax tablets, and the symbols as we would letters.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Given that the first place to be involved in the art of memory was a
      room in a house (<em>conclave</em>), it seems logical that it is mostly
      architectural locales which are recommended as the places in which to
      set symbols of what one wishes to remember. In the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
      Latin rhetorical treatise known as the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>, for
      instance, it is to architectural forms that the orator should turn as
      the most suitable places for grounding his memory:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Locos appellamus eos qui breviter, perfecte, insignite aut natura aut
      manu sunt absoluti, ut eos facile naturali memoria conprehendere et
      amplecti queamus: ut <strong>aedes, intercolumnium, angulum, fornicem, et
      alia quae his similia sunt</strong>. ([Cic.] <em>Rhet</em>. <em>Her</em>. 3.16.29)</p>
      
        <p>We call &#x201C;settings&#x201D; those places which are either naturally or
      artificially set off on a small scale, as a complete unit, and
      conspicuously, so that we can grasp and embrace them easily by our
      natural memory, such as <strong>a house, the space between two columns, a
      corner, an arch, and other settings like these.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Although the writer of the treatise suggests that the best places to set
      symbols can be either &#x201C;naturally or artificially set off&#x201D; as distinct
      (<em>aut natura aut manu&#x2026;absoluti</em>), his list of locales includes <em>only</em>
      architectural ones.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Natural spaces can of course be small in scale
      (<em>breviter</em>) and quite conspicuous (<em>insignite</em>) &#x2013; both of which are
      good qualities for constructing memory stores. It is architecture,
      though, that best provides the sense of completeness (cf. <em>perfecte</em>)
      which can give order and stability to a system of memory in which to
      place symbols.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Architectural settings give clear, distinct
      boundaries, in other words, which promote a sense of order that a fully
      natural setting on its own would seem less able to create.</p>
      
      <p>Nor does it matter in the end how conspicuous and memorable a symbol on
      it own might be. As the author of the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> stresses,
      it is absolutely essential for orators to keep the architectural
      backgrounds themselves fresh in their minds:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sed <strong>illud facere oportebit</strong>, ut identidem primos quosque <strong>locos</strong>
      imaginum renovandarum causa celeriter animo pervagemus. ([Cic.]
      <em>Rhet</em>. <em>Her</em>. 3.22.37)</p>
      
        <p>But <strong>it will be essential to do this</strong>: that we again and again run
      quickly in our minds through all the original <strong>places</strong> for the sake
      of remembering the symbols.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Orators should think of symbols that are distinctive enough to keep
      separate in their minds; even more important, though, they must be able
      to refresh the backgrounds for these symbols, or else it would seem that
      the symbols have little value for memory on their own.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">34</a></sup> If you lose
      the place, in other words, you risk losing all the symbols that go with
      it, too.</p>
      
      <p>As scholars have argued, however, these &#x201C;memory mansions&#x201D; can affect not
      just the minds of the orators, but potentially the minds of their
      audiences, as well. In her influential book on Cicero&#x2019;s use of space Ann
      Vasaly has shown the way in which the <em>ars memoriae</em> also impacted how
      the listeners of an oration would see the world around them. Since the
      &#x201C;training in the <em>ars memoriae</em> not only accustomed the orator to create
      &#x2018;visual&#x2019; pictures in his mind but taught him to associate abstract ideas
      with these pictures,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">35</a></sup> Vasaly suggests that</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Cicero may well have understood that the mnemonic technique by which
      he impressed ideas on his own mind could be employed to impress
      concepts on the minds of his listeners. [&#x2026;] Cicero&#x2019;s connection of
      ideas with specific places and objects&#x2026; might&#x2026;have figured in his
      application (whether conscious or unconscious) of the principles of
      the <em>ars memoriae</em> to the task of manipulating the thoughts and
      feelings of an audience.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">36</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>It is in part this specific understanding of the <em>ars memoriae</em> that
      leads Vasaly to conclude her study with the pithy (and oft-cited) remark
      that Cicero&#x2019;s &#x201C;constant reliance on the visual and the concrete was but
      the Roman gateway to the world of ideas.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote">37</a></sup> Although only the Roman
      orator would see the memory mansion, of course, the construction of that
      structure might have demonstrated to him the usefulness of using &#x201C;the
      concrete&#x201D; (as Vasaly puts it) in order to impact the minds of his
      listeners, too. &#x201C;This method of memory training reminds us,&#x201D; as Bettina
      Bergmann claims, &#x201C;how essential the built frame was for the Romans as an
      organizer of objects, thoughts, and experience.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It is therefore
      architecture, just as it was for Vitruvius above, which can be said to
      have provided a sense of order for the Romans &#x2013; even for a world created
      within their imaginations.</p>
      
      <p>Now that the fundamental connections between architecture and structure
      in the constructions of the Roman state and of Roman memory have been
      outlined it is possible to discuss a particular kind of architectural
      space that links these two &#x201C;structures&#x201D; even more closely. These special
      spaces which will be examined throughout the rest of this dissertation
      produced a powerful and persuasive reminder of the past in the present
      by serving as both setting and symbol at the same time. They thus acted
      as an essential means by which Romans could establish an identity for
      themselves that transcended time and (re-)defined their past as part
      their present. These incredible and fascinating structures are what the
      Romans called <em>monumenta</em> (&#x201C;monuments&#x201D;).</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-3-roman-monumenta-and-monumentality">Part 3. Roman <em>Monumenta</em> and Monumentality</h3>
      
      <p>There is a clear divide in rhetorical theory between the architectural
      settings and the symbols one places within them. As noted in the
      previous section, Cicero writes that &#x201C;while the order of places would
      keep the order of things, the symbol of the things would denote the
      things themselves.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote">39</a></sup> In the preface to Vitruvius&#x2019; treatise, however,
      Augustus&#x2019; architectural structures <em>themselves</em> seem to become the
      symbols for representing his power: they are to serve as the &#x201C;memorials&#x201D;
      (<em>memoriae</em>) to be handed down to posterity in proportion to the
      &#x201C;height&#x201D; (<em>amplitudo</em>) of the <em>princeps</em>&#x2019; achievements.<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Such
      buildings have a different effect on one&#x2019;s memory than simply being the
      background in which symbolic objects are placed; rather, they are in a
      sense the symbols, too &#x2013; just as both the Areopagus in Athens and
      Romulus&#x2019; hut on the Capitoline can come to symbolize ancient <em>mores</em> in
      Vitruvius&#x2019; eyes.<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote">41</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Architectural structures of this sort thus occupy a unique space as both
      the symbol and the setting, representing what must be remembered and the
      space that can give a solid form to that symbol in the imagination. The
      Romans had a particular word for such a structure: <em>monumentum</em>.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote">42</a></sup>
      For the Romans, at least, a <em>monumentum</em> provided not just a &#x201C;reminder&#x201D;
      of some event or person in the past; more than that, it presented a
      tangible, ordered, and often very conspicuous space in which to ground
      and sometimes redefine that memory.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote">43</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The next part of this chapter will demonstrate that the label of
      <em>monumentum</em> need not be applied to a literal building &#x2013; let alone a
      physical object &#x2013; in the text of Livy&#x2019; <em>Ab urbe condita</em>. That does not
      mean, however, that an architectural significance is ever completely
      absent from the term. In his <em>De latina lingua</em>, for instance, the
      1<sup>st</sup>-century BCE antiquarian Varro provides an etymology which stresses
      an evolution of the word along architectural lines.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Meminisse a memoria, cum in id quod remansit in mente rursus movetur;
      quae a manendo ut manimoria potest esse dicta. [&#x2026;] Ab eodem monere,
      quod is qui monet, proinde sit ac memoria; sic monimenta quae in
      <strong>sepulcris</strong>, et ideo secundum viam, quo praetereuntis admoneant et
      se fuisse et illos esse mortalis. Ab eo <strong>cetera quae scripta ac facta
      memoriae causa</strong> monimenta dicta. (Varro <em>Ling.</em> 6.49)<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote">44</a></sup></p>
      
        <p><em>Meminisse</em> (&#x201C;to remember&#x201D;) comes from <em>memoria</em> (&#x201C;memory&#x201D;), since
      there is again movement back toward that which has remained in the
      mind &#x2013; and it is possible that this word was derived from <em>manere</em>
      (&#x201C;to remain&#x201D;) like <em>manimoria.</em> [&#x2026;] From the same word comes
      <em>monere</em> (&#x201C;remind&#x201D;), because he who reminds is exactly like a memory;
      so are derived <em>monimenta</em> (&#x201C;monuments&#x201D;) which are in <strong>gravesites</strong>,
      and for that reason they are along the road so that they can remind
      passersby that they themselves lived and that the passersby are
      mortal. From this definition <strong>other things that are written or
      produced for the sake of memory</strong> are called <em>monimenta</em>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Although the word <em>monumenta</em> was originally attached to &#x201C;gravesites&#x201D;
      (<em>sepulchra</em>) along the road, Varro claims that the word eventually came
      to refer to anything &#x201C;written or produced for the sake of memory&#x201D; (cf.
      <em>cetera quae scripta ac facta memoriae causa</em>).<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote">45</a></sup> This particular
      version of the word&#x2019;s history does suggest, however, that Romans at the
      end of the republic still understood the architectural significance of
      <em>monumentum</em>; in fact, as John Bodel puts it, &#x201C;[t]he term
      <em>monumentum</em>&#x2026;was in classical Latin <em>vox propria</em> for &#x2018;tomb&#x2019;, and the
      primary purpose of a tomb.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote">46</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>A <em>monumentum</em> is thus on the one hand an object that reminds us of
      something else &#x2013; something that is absent, that is abstract, that is
      separate from us.<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote">47</a></sup> Roman monumentality creates a kind of &#x201C;aura,&#x201D; as
      Walter Benjamin would say, that produces &#x201C;a sense of distance, however
      close [an object] may be&#x201D; (<em>apparition unique d&#x2019;un lointain, si proche
      soit-il</em>).<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote">48</a></sup> And yet architectural <em>monumenta</em> are present, right in
      front of us, visible as well as tangible. It is just as important to
      acknowledge this sense of presence together with that of absence because
      of the effects that the former can have upon a viewer. For example, as
      Ja&#x15B; Elsner claims in his study on the discourse of monumentality in
      Greco-Roman historiography,</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>monuments as ideas or ideological constructs always have the added
      dimension of having been real things. They authorize discourse, and
      thus act to persuade the reader, by referring with apparent simplicity
      to artefacts outside language. [&#x2026;] They <em>exist</em> (as artefacts), and
      so what they <em>mean</em> (as signs in language) must therefore be
      true.<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote">49</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The &#x201C;present-ness&#x201D; of a monument makes it an effective form of
      persuasion. Architectural structures of stone or some other long-lasting
      material impose a sense of solidity and permanence upon the mind of an
      onlooker that helps turn such artifacts into &#x201C;proof&#x201D; that an event in
      the past happened.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote">50</a></sup> There is a reason, as discussed above in the
      preceding section, why Roman orators relied upon such structures not
      only for enhancing their own memories but even for changing the
      perspectives of their audiences. What could be a more persuasive form of
      evidence than an imposing structure that seems to resist the corrupting
      agents of time or the limits of gravity placed upon all things?</p>
      
      <p>Roman monumentality when understood in this light is not merely about
      the size or shape of a structure.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote">51</a></sup> Nor about the time and wealth
      that it took to construct it.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Nor even necessarily related to the
      monumental nature of the &#x201C;subject&#x201D; itself that is being
      commemorated.<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote">53</a></sup> All those aspects &#x2013; together with the sense of
      durability discussed above &#x2013; do contribute to monumentality. As I define
      it, however, monumentality is the ability of a structure in particular
      to suggest something significant about the past to a viewer, that is, to
      urge an onlooker to stop and reflect upon the structure&#x2019;s meaning.<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote">54</a></sup>
      I am not suggesting that all &#x201C;documents&#x201D; of the past should necessarily
      be seen as monuments, as Michel Foucault claimed that they are today by
      historians.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote">55</a></sup> It is rather the sense of having an architectural
      <em>structure</em> &#x2013; as with the original conception of the Roman <em>monumentum</em>
      as a tomb noted above &#x2013; which sets monuments apart from other objects of
      the past in this dissertation. That structure does not always have to be
      literal, of course, as we will see in the case of the poetry examined in
      the following chapters. What all these texts do have in common is the
      way they use the idea of structure inherent to Roman monumentality to
      configure the generic boundaries of their poetry &#x2013; whether by stressing
      it (Chapter III), destabilizing it (Chapter IV-V), or even transcending
      it (Chapter VI).</p>
      
      <p>The location, the size, the material, the decoration, the labor, even
      the age<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote">56</a></sup> &#x2013; all these attributes, either in total or individually,
      open up a dialogue with the viewer.<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote">57</a></sup> Why is a monument where is?
      What does its form or decoration or inscription signify? Who built it
      and why? And ultimately what does it mean to me and who I am? Those are
      just a few of the questions that a monumental structure raises in the
      imagination of whoever its audience may be. There might not be one
      meaning, of course, but the point is that a structure with monumentality
      can stimulate people who come across it to respond by thinking about its
      significance to them and by extension their place in the world.</p>
      
      <p>It is this quality of monumentality to cause reflection that makes
      monuments so important for the way that many cultures give definition to
      their own identity. For the Romans, too, as Wallace-Hadrill suggests,
      &#x201C;monumental building require[d] such a concerted attempt on the part
      of a community, [was] such a commitment of resource, and le[ft]
      behind so conspicuous a public symbol, that it is hard not to read it as
      a significant statement of identity.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote">58</a></sup> Part 1 of this chaptr
      suggested that such an understanding of monumentality underlies several
      of the passages from Vitruvius&#x2019; treatise: a <em>monumentum</em> such as the hut
      of Romulus can serve, for instance, as a mirror by which Romans could
      understand the humble <em>mores</em> of Rome&#x2019;s past &#x2013; just as the grand
      monuments of the architect&#x2019;s present could help Romans come to terms
      with the current greatness of their empire, as well as that of their new
      <em>princeps</em>.</p>
      
      <p>There is another side to monumentality, however, that is just as
      important to consider when looking at the idea of the monument in the
      Roman imagination. In the moment that a <em>monumentum</em> causes its onlooker
      to think about its meaning there is also the opportunity for him or her
      in this instant of reflection to consider the nature of monuments
      themselves. There is an opening, in other words, to think about how a
      monument works &#x2013; as well as how it might fail. In an illuminating essay
      on monuments in Roman poetry Don Fowler tried to articulate this complex
      duality which is inherent to monumentality:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>The epistemological status of the monument is an uncertain one&#x2026;
      Reading the stones is always multiple, but it cannot be so controlled:
      and it will do no good to argue that those who read the monuments
      differently must have been misreading them. [&#x2026;] The essence of the
      monument is paradoxically its lack of monumental stability, the way in
      which it is constantly reused and given new meaning, and therefore its
      inability to offer a return rather than a new journey.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote">59</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Monuments do not last forever.<sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote">60</a></sup> Yet their physical appearance is not
      the lone aspect of these structures that begins to fade away with time:
      their meaning is subject to change even more rapidly perhaps with each
      new viewer. Although modern scholarship tends to describe this
      epistemological &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of the monument as part of its so-called
      &#x201C;death&#x201D; in the 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries,<sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote">61</a></sup>
      this dissertation suggests that the Romans of the Augustan age productively
      acknowledged and even embraced the inherent malleability of meaning
      within their idea of monumentality.<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote">62</a></sup> The chapters following this one
      will examine how the Augustan poets engaged with the monumentalization
      of Rome by staging it in the monumentalization of their own poems &#x2013;
      taking advantage of the dual nature of monuments to open the process up
      to critique while contributing to it at the same time. In the concluding
      chapter I will return to the issues surrounding monumentality in our own
      present to suggest that the Romans responded to a monument&#x2019;s dual nature
      as both stable and instable epistemologically not by proclaiming its
      &#x201C;death,&#x201D; as many have today, but rather by utilizing that very same
      (seemingly paradoxical) stable flexibility to breathe new life into
      traditional structures, generic and political as much as architectural.</p>
      
      <p>Before I begin to analyze Augustan poetry, however, it will be
      beneficial to have a better sense of the sort of monumental discourse
      with which the poets were engaging. And for that I will now turn to a
      prose author and text whose monumentality has been the focus of much
      scholarship: Livy and his history of Rome <em>Ab urbe condita</em> (&#x201C;From the
      Founding of the City&#x201D;).<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote">63</a></sup> My focus here will be on Livy&#x2019;s famous
      preface. Not only will the analysis of Livy&#x2019;s text provide a taste for
      what is to follow in the examination of Augustan poets; it will also
      illustrate in action several of the ideas regarding monumentality in the
      Roman imagination discussed thus far.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-4-livys-monumental-history">Part 4. Livy&#x2019;s Monumental History</h3>
      
      <p>The Roman historian Livy started at the very beginning of the Augustan
      age to write his history on the city of Rome from its earliest days to
      his present. The preface to this immense work presents a connection
      between architecture and the state that is very similar in certain
      respects to the one that was analyzed above in the imagery of Vitruvius&#x2019;
      treatise. There is a difference, though, and a rather important one:
      whereas the architect writes about the building up of Rome, the
      historian is focused just as much on Rome&#x2019;s supposed &#x201C;collapse.&#x201D; Livy
      was writing at a time when Rome was in ruin &#x2013; both the physical city and
      the idea of the state &#x2013; and the future seemed far from certain.<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote">64</a></sup>
      What matters most for the present study is that Livy seems to put forth
      his own work as a possible solution to the breakdown of Rome&#x2019;s
      &#x201C;structure.&#x201D; He fashions his history as a <em>monumentum</em> in itself &#x2013; one
      that can anchor and materialize the past while at the same time
      utilizing the less stable side of monumentality to fashion better
      readers of Rome&#x2019;s monumentalization under Augustus.</p>
      
      <p>Several passages in Livy&#x2019;s preface aim to establish his history as
      another <em>monumentum</em> within the city of Rome. The historian quite
      explicitly uses the example of a monument, in fact, in explaining to his
      readers how they should understand his work:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum,
      omnis te exempli <strong>documenta</strong> in inlustri posita <strong>monumento</strong>
      <strong>intueri</strong>; inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capias, inde
      foedum inceptu foedum exitu quod uites. (Liv. Pr.10)<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote">65</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful part in the study
      of [past] affairs, namely, that you <strong>examine proofs</strong> of every
      possible example as set on a distinguished <strong><em>monumentum</em></strong>. You may
      then choose for yourself and your state what to imitate, as well as
      what you should avoid as bad in their beginning as they are in their
      outcome.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In this way, as scholars have argued, Livy&#x2019;s history itself also becomes
      a kind of <em>monumentum</em>.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote">66</a></sup> The language he uses here transforms his
      readers into viewers who can examine (<em>intueri</em>) the examples
      (<em>exempla</em>) that Livy puts forth in his text &#x2013; choosing to emulate the
      good and avoid the bad. This is not the first time in the preface that
      Livy uses the word <em>monumentum</em>, either. A few sentences earlier he
      mentions that he is not going to affirm or deny the tales of Rome&#x2019;s
      early history which he claims are &#x201C;more fitting for poetic stories than
      for the incorruptible <em>monumenta</em> of accomplishments&#x201D; (<em>poeticis magis
      decora fabulis quam incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis</em>, Pr. 6). It
      is clear here, too, that Livy sees his work as on par with <em>monumenta</em>.
      It is important to note, moreover, that for Livy these &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; take
      on the quality of being able to display an established truth as opposed
      to poems which are filled with mere &#x201C;stories&#x201D; (<em>fabulae</em>). It would
      seem, in other words, that the historian fashions his history as a
      <em>monumentum</em> at least in part because of the ability that monuments have
      to serve as more fitting sources of &#x201C;proof&#x201D; than mere words themselves.
      As discussed in the previous section, architectural <em>monumenta</em> do at
      least appear to have a certain stability &#x2013; physical and therefore
      epistemological &#x2013; which can lend credence to the events of the past that
      they commemorate. And it is precisely because of their status as
      (seemingly) stable evidence that Livy claims they can present actual
      <em>exempla</em> from the past to imitate or avoid.</p>
      
      <p>Livy&#x2019;s use of architectural imagery is much more nuanced, however, and
      it will be necessary to examine the architectural nature of a few other
      passages from the preface to grasp more accurately what he sees as the
      purpose of his work.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote">67</a></sup> Just a couple of sentences earlier, for
      instance, Livy talks of his work in the context of other writers who
      have done or will do more than he has &#x2013; and thus cast him and his work
      into obscurity:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;si in tanta scriptorum turba mea fama <strong>in obscuro</strong> sit, nobilitate
      ac <strong>magnitudine</strong> eorum me qui nomini officient meo consoler. (Liv.
      Pr.3)</p>
      
        <p>&#x2026;if in such a great crowd of writers my own reputation should be
      thrown <strong>into the shade</strong>, I would console myself with the renown and
      <strong>greatness</strong> of those who obscure my fame.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Here the architectural metaphor applies to more than just Livy&#x2019;s work:
      other historians have in a sense &#x201C;erected&#x201D; histories whose great size
      will throw his history into their shade. They not only have a certain
      nobility (<em>nobilitas</em>) because of their undertakings, but their works
      also have a certain magnitude (<em>magnitudo</em>). Given the way that Livy
      carefully configures his work as a <em>monumentum</em> it seems likely here
      that he means something more than huge volumes that exceed his in
      physical size. Each history is seen by Livy as a &#x201C;monument&#x201D; in its own
      right &#x2013; perhaps just like the ones that had begun to fill Rome as the
      <em>princeps</em> started to assert his power and transform the architectural
      landscape of the city in the early 20s BCE.</p>
      
      <p>There is even more to examine here, though. Livy&#x2019;s metaphorical use of
      <em>magnitudo</em> in this passage is not far from the way examined earlier
      that Vitruvius employed <em>amplitudo</em> in relation to the transformation of
      the Roman state under Augustus.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote">68</a></sup> And Livy not surprisingly justifies
      his own work &#x2013; which is by no means small &#x2013; by juxtaposing it to the
      &#x201C;size&#x201D; of the Roman state, too:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Res est praeterea et immensi operis, ut quae supra septingentesimum
      annum repetatur et quae ab exiguis profecta initiis eo creuerit ut iam
      <strong>magnitudine</strong> laboret sua. (Liv. Pr.4)</p>
      
        <p>The subject, moreover, is also one of an immense labor, as one which
      we must investigate starting from over 700 years ago and which, having
      originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
      now toils under its own <strong>great size</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Even if the Roman historian&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> is not the largest, it is by
      no means small, either. Livy&#x2019;s topic necessitates a certain &#x201C;size,&#x201D; as
      he immediately goes on to say, because the subject &#x2013; that is, the
      history of Rome &#x2013; requires an immense amount of work (cf. <em>res est
      praeterea et immensi operis</em>). Livy&#x2019;s monument must be large enough, in
      other words, to cover the whole history of Rome &#x2013; a place which, having
      &#x201C;originated from humble beginnings, has grown to such an extent that it
      toils under its own great size&#x201D; (<em>ab exiguis profecta initiis eo
      creverit ut iam magnitudine laboret sua</em>).</p>
      
      <p>The architectural imagery in the preface thus extends to more than
      simply Livy&#x2019;s own history, or even those of his peers; it also extends
      to the greatness of Rome itself. Livy is thus clearly participating in
      the same tradition of looking at the Roman state architecturally that
      was examined above in the works of Ennius, Cicero, and, most notably,
      Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote">69</a></sup> It is important to note, however, that unlike Vitruvius
      the historian here speaks of a state &#x2013; and the <em>mores</em> upon which it was
      founded &#x2013; not increasing in magnificence but instead in terms that
      suggests its gradual &#x201C;collapse,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote">70</a></sup> as the following passage
      demonstrates:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>labente</strong> deinde paulatim <strong>disciplina</strong> uelut <strong>dissidentes</strong><sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote">71</a></sup>
      primo mores sequatur animo, deinde ut magis magisque <strong>lapsi sint</strong>,
      tum <strong>ire</strong> coeperint <strong>praecipites</strong>&#x2026; (Liv. Pr.9)</p>
      
        <p>Then as gradually morality <strong>declines</strong>, let [the reader] follow how
      our <em>mores</em> at first <strong>fractured</strong>, then <strong>collapsed</strong> more and more,
      and finally began <strong>to plunge into headlong ruin</strong>&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The very same <em>mores</em> that were the foundations upon which we saw Ennius
      and Cicero claim the Roman state stood (<em>moribus antiquis res stat
      romana virisque</em>) have gradually weakened over the course of Rome&#x2019;s
      history until the point that they have now &#x201C;collapsed&#x201D; (<em>lapsi</em>) &#x2013; and
      sent the state into ruin with them (<em>ire</em>&#x2026;<em>praecipites</em>).<sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote">72</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>In the above analysis of Vitruvius&#x2019; treatise it was argued that to view
      the state architecturally also meant that its physical architecture
      would become symbolic for the idea of the <em>res publica</em> itself. This is
      significant for the present discussion of Livy because the physical
      setting of Rome had deteriorated much in the 1st century BCE, at least
      from the perspective of texts of the period which connect this apparent
      physical deterioration to that of state&#x2019;s metaphorical structure and
      <em>mores</em>. For example, Horace emphatically begins one of his famous
      &#x201C;Roman <em>Odes</em>&#x201D; with a lament for &#x201C;the collapsing (<em>labentis</em>) temples of
      the gods&#x201D; &#x2013; together with an exhortation to Romans to &#x201C;restore&#x201D;
      (<em>reficere</em>) them if they are ever to atone for the sins of their
      fathers committed during the civil wars:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Delicta maiorum inmeritus lues,
      Romane, donec <strong>templa refeceris</strong>
      <strong>aedisque abentis</strong> deorum et
      foeda nigro simulacra fumo. (Hor. <em>C</em>. 3.6.1-4)</p>
      
        <p>Though you do not deserve it, Roman, you will continue to atone for
      your fathers&#x2019; sins, until you have <strong>restored the temples and the
      collapsing shrines</strong> of all the gods and their images defiled with
      black smoke.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>For the poet the physical renewal of Rome is absolutely essential to its
      metaphorical reconstruction: the Romans cannot make up for the damage
      they did to the state in the past until they rebuild the temples that
      represented their former virtues. The <em>monumenta</em> in Rome had begun to
      crack, in other words, and so had its people&#x2019;s belief in the virtue that
      these structures were supposed to represent.<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote">73</a></sup> For Rome to
      re-establish itself and breathe life back into the values it had relied
      upon during its rise to power not only did someone have to improve the
      physical landscape of the city &#x2013; or restore (<em>reficere</em>) it, as Horace
      writes &#x2013; but that person also had to re-establish the belief in that
      landscape&#x2019;s ability to reflect what it meant to be Roman as it had done
      in the past.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote">74</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>If that is the case, though, an interesting question arises: how should
      one read Livy&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> in the context of such &#x201C;ruin&#x201D;? What purpose
      does it have when it would seem that the &#x201C;structures&#x201D; of Rome&#x2019;s past
      have themselves collapsed? It has been suggested that Livy&#x2019;s
      <em>monumentum</em> represents a small part of a rehabilitation process &#x2013; not
      just as another monument to Rome, but also as a means of revitalizing
      the Roman people&#x2019;s belief in the structures that these monuments were
      meant to symbolize.<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote">75</a></sup> As Mary Jaeger has shown in her monograph on
      the topic, however, the process by which Livy accomplishes this task is
      not a simple one. Jaeger argues that the historian&#x2019;s focus on monuments
      both provides lessons about the past and at the same time should make a
      reader suspicious of those same lessons. Since Livy must rely on
      imperfect monuments of the past to construct his history, his work
      simultaneously cannot but &#x201C;remind the reader that a coherent account of
      real past events is not a reproduction but a reconstruction.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote">76</a></sup>
      Jaeger looks particularly at <em>monumenta</em> in the text that &#x201C;fail to point
      unambiguously back to a particular person or event&#x201D; in order to show how
      Livy provides an alternative perspective to Augustus&#x2019; &#x201C;Golden Age&#x201D;
      Rome.<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote">77</a></sup> This is not so much to critique the <em>princeps</em>&#x2019;
      monumentalization of the city as to &#x201C;construct a reader&#x201D; who could play
      in active role in interpreting monuments and thus make &#x201C;national memory
      personal.&#x201D; The historian accomplished this task, according to Jaeger, by
      making sure that his readers would &#x201C;receiv[e] Livy&#x2019;s interpretation of
      the past, not just as images in the mind&#x2019;s eye, but as a heightened and
      altered awareness of the space around him or her.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote">78</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It was not Livy&#x2019;s responsibility alone to &#x201C;construct&#x201D; readers who could
      critically read Augustus&#x2019; monumentalization of Rome and understand their
      place in it. Subsequent chapters of this dissertation will show how the
      historian was indeed not the only writer in the Augustan age to critique
      the project of monumentalization to which he was also contributing
      through his monumental work. The critical assessment of Rome&#x2019;s
      transformation that I argue can be found in several poets of the
      Augustan age may have been just as important part of its eventual
      success as the historian&#x2019;s contribution.</p>
      
      <p>Before I turn to how these poets contributed to this project, though, it
      is time to return to where this chapter began, namely, with Augustus and
      his <em>Res Gestae</em>. Although I will come back to the <em>princeps</em>&#x2019; version
      of his transformation of Rome in much more detail at the end of each
      subsequent chapter (with the exception of Chapter IV), the present
      analysis of Augustus&#x2019; language here in the final section of this chapter
      will help to demonstrate how the <em>princeps</em> dealt with the
      reconstruction of the state&#x2019;s appearance not just in reality, but in the
      Roman imagination, as well, from the very start of his account.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-5-a-monument-to-the-monumentalization-of-rome">Part 5. A Monument to the Monumentalization of Rome</h3>
      
      <p>In the opening chapter of his <em>Res Gestae</em> Augustus speaks of the two
      charges that he received when he first came into real power:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>res publica</strong> <strong>n[e quid detrimenti caperet,]</strong> me pro praetore
      simul cum consulibus pro[videre iussit. p]opulus autem eodem anno me
      consulem, cum [consul uterqu]e in bel[lo ceci]desset, et
      <strong>triumvirum rei publicae constituend[ae</strong> creavit]. (<em>RGDA</em> 1.3-4)</p>
      
        <p>The state ordered me as a propraetor to take care together with the
      consuls <strong>that it not be diminished in any way</strong>. In the same year,
      moreover, the people elected me as consul, when both consuls had died
      in war, and as triumvir <strong><em>rei publicae constituendae</em></strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>As a <em>propraetor</em> the young Octavian was assigned by the state itself to
      take care &#x201C;lest it be diminished in any way&#x201D; (<em>ne quid detrimenti
      caperet</em>). In the same year, moreover, the people elected him as consul
      and triumvir <em>rei publicae constituendae</em>. The wording of these two
      charges is not entirely unexpected or remarkable. The first was the
      &#x201C;usual formula&#x201D; for addressing emergencies in the late republic when a
      <em>senatus consultum ultimum</em> (SCU) was issued.<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote">79</a></sup> And <em>rei publicae
      constituendae</em> is a stock phrase of sorts &#x2013; one that might have
      originated with Sulla,<sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote">80</a></sup> one which was used often by Cicero in his
      works,<sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote">81</a></sup> and one that can be found on several denarii minted by the
      individuals of second triumvirate themselves.<sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote">82</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>These two tasks are thus not altogether novel &#x2013; and Augustus certainly
      did not invent the language for them. But they do reflect something
      important about the Roman state suggested at length in this chapter,
      that is, the connection between architecture and the idea of the Roman
      state in the language that Romans used to discuss their <em>res publica</em>.
      There is the sense here, in other words, of there being a &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of
      the <em>res publica</em> in the words that Augustus uses to talk about his
      charges. For one, the word <em>detrimentum</em>, whose primary definition is
      &#x201C;material reduction&#x201D; or &#x201C;diminishment,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote">83</a></sup> is derived from <em>detero</em> &#x2013;
      a verb that is specifically related to the wearing down of physical
      objects, such as streets (in Lucretius) or tablets (in
      Propertius).<sup id="fnref:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote">84</a></sup> Moreover, although most translations of <em>rei publicae
      constituendae</em> read something like &#x201C;for settling the state,&#x201D; or &#x201C;for
      setting the state to rights&#x201D; (as one scholar translates it in a recent
      book which addresses the topic),<sup id="fnref:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote">85</a></sup> the verb <em>constituo</em> and its noun
      <em>constitutio</em><sup id="fnref:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote">86</a></sup> are commonly used to refer both to the &#x201C;founding&#x201D; of
      a city and its laws,<sup id="fnref:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote">87</a></sup> as well as to the &#x201C;construction&#x201D; of a
      building such as a house, as seen above in the passages from
      Vitruvius.<sup id="fnref:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote">88</a></sup> Even at this early point in the <em>Res Gestae</em>, then, a
      reader would come across a subtle balancing act that the <em>princeps</em>
      performs again and again throughout the document: while Augustus was in
      charge of making sure that the &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; which Livy writes about did
      not continue, he simultaneously had to construct the Roman state anew.
      In other words, whereas Augustus needed to build a new Rome out of the
      ruin (<em>rei publicae constituendae</em>), he also needed to avoid damaging
      the traditional structure itself in any obvious way.</p>
      
      <p>Are these empty metaphors typical of an Augustan inscription? That
      possibility cannot entirely be ruled out, of course. What I would like
      to propose, however, is that the wording here and elsewhere in the <em>Res
      Gestae</em> suggests something essential about how Augustus articulated for
      posterity his (re-)construction of Rome upon its traditional
      foundations. It does not seem unreasonable, for instance, to connect the
      architectural discourse in the <em>RGDA</em> to the complex idea of the
      monument that underlies Augustus&#x2019; famous quote to have left Rome a city
      of marble examined in Chapter I.<sup id="fnref:118"><a href="#fn:118" class="footnote">89</a></sup> It is in fact the goal of each of
      the following the chapters to flesh out the nuances of this connection
      by juxtaposing later sections of the <em>Res Gestae</em> with close analysis of
      the <em>monumenta</em> that poets of the Augustan age built through their
      poems.</p>
      
      <p>It is certainly correct to say that &#x201C;Augustus used the physical
      topography of the city to his advantage: through the reorganization of
      the urban environment of Rome, he effectively communicated that a change
      had taken place.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:119"><a href="#fn:119" class="footnote">90</a></sup> And the way that the Augustan poets treated that
      topography in their poetry allowed Romans more fully to appreciate and
      better interpret the specific monuments of their physical reality. The
      point of this dissertation is to show how Horace, Vergil, and Ovid also
      helped their readers to navigate the architectural <em>discourse</em> that
      Augustus would use in his <em>Res Gestae</em> to articulate this
      monumentalization of their city. These three poets each provides a
      mirror, I will argue, by which we can understand how Augustus used
      architectural discourse to redefine, without appearing to knock down,
      the traditional boundaries that had &#x201C;structured&#x201D; the Roman state up to
      his time. By analyzing how they expand, test, and dissolve the generic
      boundaries of their poems <em>qua</em> &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; we can come to recognize the
      effectiveness of the <em>Res Gestae</em> to celebrate the monumentalization of
      Rome in reality as well as the idea of it in the Roman imagination. The
      rest of this dissertation will propose, in short, that the Augustan
      poets helped to fashion readers who could better understand what had
      happened to their Rome, real and imagined, through the lens of
      architectural discourse that their poetry helped to sharpen.</p>

      framed the viewing of Augustan Rome. For it told Romans how their

      themselves, as the latter has been topic of much scholarship in
      recent years. See Zanker 1988 for an approach to Augustan
      architecture that focuses on the architectural remains that have
      survived either physically or through the images from coins,
      painting, and literature. Ward-Perkins 1981 [1994], 21-45, and
      Favro 1998 present excellent overviews of Augustan architecture&#x2019;s
      importance from this perspective, as well &#x2013; the latter suggesting
      that &#x201C;Augustus sparked a reconceptualization of the city&#x2019;s physical
      form as a bearer of meaning&#x201D; (216). But see also Galinsky 1996 and
      Wallace-Hadrill 2008 for analyses of Augustan culture that

      of human thought and architecture, as the nineteenth-century
      Frenchman would write that &#x201C;[a]rchitecture&#x2026;developed together
      with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a

            <p>Several scholars have noted the importance of the Roman
      conceptualization of architecture to rhetoric and the Roman
      conceptualization of rhetoric to architecture. Frith 2004, 41,
      claims that &#x201C;[i]f the task of architecture is to represent order,
      its means are enabled by <em>eloquence</em>. [&#x2026;] The significance of
      the reliance by Vitruvius on rhetoric cannot be overstated.
      Architecture takes on the character of oratory in Western
      traditions, such that buildings are expected to &#x2018;say&#x2019; something.&#x201D;
      See also F. R. Brown 1963, Bek 1976, Gros 1991, Callebat 1994, Caye
      2011, and now Elsner and Meyer 2014, 35-114, esp. E. Thomas 2014,
      each of which takes a slightly different approach to the
      intersection of the &#x201C;architecture&#x201D; of architecture and that of
      rhetoric (and <em>vice versa</em>). See also Woodman 1988, 81-95, for an
      overview of Cicero&#x2019;s use of architectural metaphors for discussing

      Perrault in his edition of Vitruvius, &#x201C;[a]rchitecture is of all
      the sciences the one to which the Greeks gave a name signifying
      superiority and stewardship over the others&#x201D; (cited in Hollier 1989,
      36). See also Ruskin 1849, 205, claiming that &#x201C;architecture must be
      the beginning of arts, and that the others must follow her in their
      time and order.&#x201D; For how Vitruvius is in possible dialogue here with
      Stoic philosophy see also McEwan 2003, 57, arguing that &#x201C;Vitruvius
      understood architecture in terms of a purposeful universe, a
      world-body shot through with same cohesive ratio that made, for
      Cato, the Stoic system which reflected it &#x2018;so well constructed, so
      firmly jointed and welded into one.&#x2019; It is especially in its

      nothing becomes legible unless it is submitted to the architectural

      approach to this topic and argues that &#x201C;[a]rchitecture is a
      materialization of structure, and the adoption of architecture as a

      the Greco-Roman world, McEwan 1993, 73-74, goes so far as to suggest
      that &#x201C;if we understand the craftsman as a <em>demiourgos</em> in the wider
      Greek sense of the term, yet retain the primordiality of the notion
      of craft in its more limited, physical sense, as the early Greeks
      did when they claimed that there was no community, no civilization,
      without such craft, then it becomes quite clear that the emergence
      of Greek politics &#x2013; indeed of Western politics &#x2013; hinged upon the
      craft tradition, and upon how craft was understood&#x201D;; in fact,
      according to McEwan, &#x201C;all of Western thinking was first grounded in
      architecture&#x201D; (130). See also Senseney 2011, 9, where he argues for
      a connection between architectural drawing and the birth of Western
      philosophy. One of Senseney&#x2019;s primary contentions is that we should
      understand the &#x201C;relationship between drawing, seeing, and the birth
      of theoretical philosophy as an inward seeing associated with
      knowledge (&#x2018;insight&#x2019;), ways of envisioning nature, and even the

      Wilson 1988, 76, where he suggests that &#x201C;[i]n many ways the memory
      system of Cicero is a reversal of the &#x2018;order&#x2019; of events in which

      &#x201C;Architecture&#x201D; (1910) Alfred Loos describes one&#x2019;s experience of
      architectural structures along fairly similar lines: &#x201C;When walking
      through a wood, you find a rise in the ground, six foot long and
      three foot wide, heaped up in a rough pyramid shape, then you turn
      serious, and something inside you says: someone lies buried here.

      Greek and Roman &#x201C;Others,&#x201D; as well, see also Elsner 1994, 228-229,
      where he argues that a &#x201C;monument, the product of a people, can serve
      to epitomise what is typical about them. It can freeze what is&#x2026;the
      essence of a people in a convenient and accessible miniature. The
      monument becomes not only the product of, but also a metonym for the
      race, the culture, the way of living, the rationality and
      expectations of the people and environment. [&#x2026;] They encapsulate
      identity by embodying the past as it exists in the present; they
      focus in terms of the past the present&#x2019;s sense of being what it is.&#x201D;
      On the connection between architecture and identity more broadly see
      also Norberg-Schulz 1971, 29, claiming that &#x201C;[d]uring his [or
      her] development the individual discovers a structured whole which
      he [or she] shares with others and which more than anything else
      gives him [or her] a sense of identity,&#x201D; and Sherratt 1990, 165,
      where the scholar concludes that &#x201C;[m]egalith building became the
      metaphor within which social conflicts and ideological competition
      were played out. In this sense, megaliths were as much a cause as a

            <p>Many scholars of monumentality today have discounted the Roman
      version of the concept as facile. See Choay 2001, 19, arguing in her
      landmark study on the idea of the monument in Western culture that
      the monuments of the Romans &#x2013; while seemingly based on a modern
      conception of monumentality &#x2013; were &#x201C;not oriented toward a vision of
      the past&#x201D; in the way that modern ones are; rather, according to
      Choay, these monumental structures were &#x201C;motivated by taste and a
      desire [on the part of the Romans] to infuse themselves visually
      with the plastic world of Greece.&#x201D; See also Riegl 1903, 10, claiming
      that &#x201C;[a]ll of Antiquity and the Middle Ages in essence only knew
      intentional monuments&#x201D; (<em>Das ganze Altertum und Mittelalter haben
      nun im Grunde blo&#xDF; gewollte Denkmale gekannt</em>). In the same essay,
      though, Riegl would at least admit that the Romans presented &#x201C;an
      anachronistic precursor of modern commemorative value&#x201D; (<em>ein
      anachronistischer Vorl&#xE4;ufer des modernen Erinnerungswertes</em>). As I
      demonstrate in this dissertation, however, the Roman understanding
      of <em>monumenta</em> was highly-developed and perhaps even more nuanced in
      certain respects than the way many look at monuments today. <a href="#fnref:91" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

      abiding monument, its solidity will help shore up the collapsing
      edifice of the Roman state&#x2026; In important senses, therefore, it may
      be said that for Livy AUC history is his own work, the <em>Ab urbe
      condita</em>, and that in reconstructing Roman history he is in a moral
      sense reconstructing contemporary Rome.&#x201D; See also Wheeldon 1989, 59,

      for the value of <em>historiae</em> as sources of right conduct, Livy
      offers first, in the image of monumentality, a summation of the
      earlier claims for his work (on the basis of its size and the labor
      involved in writing it) and second, in the order in which the
      metaphors of the two passages appear, the more ambitious suggestion
      of the reconstruction &#x2013; via the reading of his own work &#x2013; of Roman
      greatness.&#x201D; It is not just Rome that he is reconstructing, I would

            <p>See Hurlet 1993, 95, stating that &#x201C;<em>rem publicam constituere</em>
      refers to both the founding of cities and establishing laws;
      furthermore, it does not strictly recover the theoretical
      constructions of philosophers &#x2013; essentially that of Plato, to whom
      Cicero is constantly looking &#x2013; but has a concrete meaning and still
      applies to constitutions and real states. <em>Rem publicam constituere</em>
      must be translated not as &#x2018;to draft a fictional constitution&#x2019; but as
      &#x2018;to give foundation (a constitution) to the State&#x2019;&#x201D; (rem publicam
      constituere <em>d&#xE9;signe &#xE0; la fois la fondation de cit&#xE9;s et
      l&#x2019;&#xE9;tablissement de lois; en outre, elle ne recouvre pas formellement
      les constructions th&#xE9;oriques des philosophes &#x2013; essentiellement celle
      de Platon, &#xE0; laquelle pense constamment Cic&#xE9;ron &#x2013; mais poss&#xE8;de un
      sens concret et s&#x2019;applique toujours aux constitutions et aux Etats
      r&#xE9;els.</em> Rem publicam constituere <em>doit donc &#xEA;tre traduit non pas par
      &#x2018;r&#xE9;diger une constitution fictive&#x2019; mais par &#x2018;donner des fondements
      (une constitution) &#xE0; l&#x2019;Etat</em>&#x2019;). See also Fleury 1990, 55, noting in
      his commentary on Book 1 of Vitruvius&#x2019; <em>De architectura</em> that
      &#x201C;<em>constituere</em> is used to talk about the organization of a province
      by a magistrate invested with <em>imperium</em>&#x201D; (constituere <em>s&#x2019;emploie
      aussi pour parler de l&#x2019;organisation d&#x2019;une province par un magistrate
      muni de l&#x2019;</em>imperium). <a href="#fnref:116" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>
