      <p>&#x201C;I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as a city of
      brick.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Augustus&#x2019; famous boast is not without merit. The people of
      Rome no doubt witnessed an incredible amount of building in their city
      under the reign of the <em>princeps</em>. For nearly two millennia historians
      have praised the Augustan age for its prolific and resplendent
      architecture.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Classicists in particular have analyzed Augustus&#x2019;
      sophisticated building program in order to show how the visual culture
      of Rome was an essential component of the so-called Augustan &#x201C;(Cultural)
      Revolution&#x201D; that saw the city rise out of decades of civil war into an
      era of peace and relative stability.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The recent attention to, and
      fascination with, the physical remains of Rome&#x2019;s many Augustan monuments
      &#x2013; small or large, functional or commemorative &#x2013; is a testament to just
      how successfully Augustus employed architecture to monumentalize not
      just the city of Rome, but the very idea of the city in the imagination
      of the Romans, as well as in the minds of their cultural inheritors.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This dissertation is not about the physical monuments that Augustus
      constructed. Important work still remains to be done in that field of
      study as classicists complete the &#x201C;spatial turn&#x201D; and transition from an
      examination of space to that of movement in and through space.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The
      different focus of my dissertation is rather because some of the most
      important monumental constructions that Augustus accomplished were not
      constructed with extravagant, long-lasting marble, but with the words of
      the Latin language in his <em>Res Gestae</em>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Augustus did monumentalize
      the city of Rome, of course, but he also &#x201C;constructed&#x201D; the <em>res publica</em>
      anew after years of civil strife had left it in &#x201C;ruin.&#x201D; That was his
      charge, after all, when he first assumed power as a <em>triumvir rei
      publicae constituendae</em>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> As this study will suggest, an essential
      part of Augustus&#x2019; success in accomplishing this task was in how he
      skillfully used architectural <em>discourse</em> to establish his novel
      <em>constitutio</em> for Rome &#x2013; the one in the imagination as much as the
      physical one &#x2013; upon foundations that were at the same time
      traditional.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Augustus was not alone in using architectural discourse to articulate
      the work he did to reshape the idea of Rome. Far from it. To think that
      the <em>princeps</em> was operating outside the shared discourse of his times
      is no doubt a mistake &#x2013; and one that does not fully account for his
      success.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Chapter II of this dissertation will demonstrate the
      important role that architectural discourse and in particular the idea
      of the monument played for Romans in how they &#x201C;structured&#x201D; the world
      around them, whether rhetorical or literary, actual or symbolic. This
      largely introductory chapter will start with an analysis of the only
      surviving intact architectural treatise from antiquity, Vitruvius&#x2019; <em>De
      architectura</em>, which was addressed to Augustus himself. I will analyze
      in particular the treatise&#x2019;s architectural imagery so as to draw out
      further the close connection that existed between architecture and the
      idea of &#x201C;order&#x201D; or &#x201C;structure&#x201D; in the Roman imagination.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> From this
      point I will then turn to perhaps the most famous example of this
      connection in antiquity: the &#x201C;memory mansion&#x201D; that was used by Roman
      orators as an <em>aide</em>-<em>m&#xE9;moire</em>. The idea of using architecture to
      &#x201C;structure&#x201D; one&#x2019;s thoughts is not limited to constructing memory,
      however, but is in fact emblematic of a much deeper connection that
      existed between physical structures and the way Romans conceived of the
      world around them conceptually. And nowhere is this relationship more
      apparent than in the Roman idea of monumentality, that is, those
      characteristics which make something into a <em>monumentum</em> (&#x201C;monument&#x201D;). A
      discussion of Roman monumentality will lead then to an analysis of two
      Augustan authors who demonstrate the concept in action, namely, the
      historian Livy in the preface of his <em>Ab urbe condita</em> and the
      <em>princeps</em> himself at the beginning of his own <em>Res Gestae</em>.</p>
      
      <p>This examination of monumental architecture&#x2019;s relationship to Roman
      thought as found in these prose texts is essential to establishing a new
      interpretative framework through which to analyze the way that the poets
      of the Augustan age conceived of their works as <em>monumenta</em>. Most
      studies on the poetic <em>monumenta</em> that will be analyzed in this
      dissertation have examined either [1] the metapoetics at work in each
      case (e.g., as a &#x201C;competition,&#x201D; whether between Greek vs. Roman, past
      vs. present, or visual vs. verbal media),<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> or [2] tried to match
      these &#x201C;structures&#x201D; with actual monuments in Augustan Rome.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Although
      I will also draw upon both approaches in this dissertation, my goal is
      to explore how the poets who built these <em>monumenta</em> are interacting
      with &#x2013; that is, employing as well as critiquing &#x2013; the architectural
      <em>discourse</em> that existed in Augustan Rome and which was used by Augustus
      himself to articulate his monumentalization of the city.</p>
      
      <p>The prose texts examined in Chapter II will provide a framework for
      interpreting the poetic monuments of the Augustan age in a new light.
      But why poetry? What does it offer that further analysis of prose
      cannot? The Greco-Roman tradition is full of poets who imagined their
      works architecturally<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> &#x2013; whether as grand, stable structures,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
      or in the case of Hellenistic poetry as a means of articulating their
      (supposedly) much smaller poetic aspirations.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> The Augustan poets
      were thus working within a long-standing, established tradition that
      attached architectural imagery to what we today might call a poem&#x2019;s
      &#x201C;generic structure.&#x201D; For these poets to make a metapoetic statement via
      architectural imagery was a highly self-reflexive enterprise &#x2013; one which
      not only called attention to their poetic predecessors, but also allowed
      them to articulate their own poems as a particular type of poetry.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>
      These intensely marked &#x201C;architextural&#x201D; moments therefore enabled the
      Augustan poets in particular to explore the monumentalization of the
      space around them in a critical way as they contemplated how their own
      works <em>qua</em> &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; would contribute to it.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>A bit about definitions before I provide a summary of the remaining
      chapters which will follow. I use the term &#x201C;architexture&#x201D; in this
      dissertation not to call to mind the complex architectonic
      &#x201C;topomorphology&#x201D; of Augustan age poetry that has been the focus of
      countless studies on its structural arrangement (in terms of books,
      individual poems, lines, etc.).<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Nor do I use &#x201C;architexture&#x201D; in a
      loose way to talk about how &#x201C;memory is constructed like a text.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> My
      use of the term is closes to how the influential French narratologist
      G&#xE9;rard Genette employed the almost impossibly nuanced concept of
      &#x201C;<em>architextualit&#xE9;</em>&#x201D; for thinking about how a text fits into a particular
      generic structure (or what he calls an &#x201C;<em>archigenre</em>&#x201D;).<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Genette is
      not concerned, however, with the more straightforward way that texts
      themselves can configure this relationship in their very language. My
      use of the word architexture is meant to examine this connection, that
      is, to explore how architecture is an operative metaphor in Horace,
      Vergil, and Ovid for how they imagine the generic &#x201C;structures&#x201D; of their
      own poetry. This dissertation is not simply about metapoetics, however.
      I argue that the act of defining their poetry&#x2019;s architexture offered
      these three poets a vehicle through which to engage critically with the
      discourse surrounding architectural monuments &#x2013; a discourse which itself
      was critical to reshaping and redefining Rome in the Augustan age.</p>
      
      <p>Chapters III-VI will demonstrate the relative strengths and weaknesses
      of this discourse by examining the monumental architexture of Horace&#x2019;s
      <em>Odes</em> (23 BCE), Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em> (18 BCE), and Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorophoses</em>
      (8 CE) in juxtaposition to that of Augustus&#x2019; own <em>Res Gestae</em> (14 CE).
      In order to tease out the subtle nuances of this sophisticated discourse
      in the space provided by a dissertation-length study I will be examining
      closely these texts themselves. I will therefore not be providing an
      in-depth architectural analysis of any physical monumental structure in
      Rome. This does not mean that I believe the physical environment of the
      city was at all irrelevant to how and why the Augustan poets built their
      poetic <em>monumenta</em>. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid &#x2013; these three authors
      experienced first-hand the transformation of Rome into a city of marble
      monuments during the span of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> It is not
      surprising, then, that they might turn to monumental architecture as the
      signifier with which to express something about their own
      &#x201C;constructions.&#x201D; What I want to emphasize again is that my focus will be
      on how real and poetic monuments are discussed &#x2013; and to what ends &#x2013; by
      Augustus and the poets of his age. These poets and their <em>princeps</em> were
      all tapping into the common language which monumental discourse supplied
      when they articulated what made their works monumental. And it is that
      discourse which is in much greater need of scholarly attention than the
      physical structures themselves.</p>
      
      <p>I will begin my analysis of Roman architexture in Chapter III with
      Horace&#x2019;s lyrical <em>Odes</em>. After consistently making claims that one
      should aim for the &#x201C;golden mean&#x201D; (<em>aurea mediocritas</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.10.5) and
      outwardly lamenting the excesses of contemporary architecture,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> the
      poet appears to make a remarkable &#x201C;about-face&#x201D; at the end of his first
      publication of the collection. In the final poem, <em>C</em>. 3.30, Horace
      claims to have built a <em>monumentum</em> that will not only be higher than
      the pyramids but which will even escape the grasp of decaying time
      itself. I will argue that this apparent contradiction between the
      content of his lyric and the &#x201C;form&#x201D; which he ultimately gives it is
      anticipated throughout the <em>Odes</em> by a type of rhetorical disavowal &#x2013;
      what I term an &#x201C;inverted&#x201D; <em>recusatio</em> &#x2013; that allows the poet to
      incorporate into his lyric structure that which he claims to
      exclude.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> By using this rhetorical device to establish a delicate
      though perfect balance of tensions Horace can erect a dynamic and
      innovative &#x201C;monument&#x201D; of lyric poetry while &#x2013; or rather <em>through</em> &#x2013;
      claiming to be &#x201C;traditional.&#x201D; This method of innovating without
      destabilizing the structure of the tradition will then be compared to
      the strategies that Augustus used when discussing his own buildings in
      the <em>Res Gestae</em>. Both poet and <em>princeps</em>, I will suggest, use the idea
      of a stable structure provided by monuments to balance present
      innovations against past traditions &#x2013; generic for the one, social and
      political for the other.</p>
      
      <p>The subsequent analysis of Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em> in Chapters IV-V will
      likewise examine what the epic poet has to say about architecture and
      monuments in the poem before then turning to how he might be fashioning
      his poem itself as a <em>monumentum</em>. Because of the epic&#x2019;s size it will be
      necessary to break up the analysis of its architexture into two separate
      chapters. Chapter IV will treat two of the most common and significant
      architectural tropes of the poem, artificial caves and deceptive
      labyrinths, as they demonstrate a very different focus on the part of
      the poet from what can be found in the <em>Odes</em>. The disruptive forces of
      Vergil&#x2019;s poem are not external, but rather are shown to have been
      trapped <em>inside</em> these grand structures. As we will see, however,
      despite their size and divine craftsmanship these constructions are
      shown to &#x201C;fail&#x201D; again and again &#x2013; thereby releasing the violent forces
      of Rome&#x2019;s past contained within them.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Chapter V will then focus in
      particular on the epic&#x2019;s <em>monumenta</em> &#x2013; including the ones that Anchises
      (mis)remembers while on Crete, the ones found on Doors of Daedalus in
      the form of the Minotaur, the ones in the environs of pre-Rome, and the
      multiple ones that the baldric of Pallas may represent<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> &#x2013; before
      turning to how they all can help us to understand the poem itself as a
      kind of <em>monumentum</em>.</p>
      
      <p>Taken together Chapters IV and V will examine the way that Vergil&#x2019;s
      architexture is less about keeping out those external forces which could
      disrupt the <em>status quo</em> than about the chaos and violence of Rome&#x2019;s
      past &#x2013; distant and very recent &#x2013; that the poem-as-monument tries to
      contain within its magnificent epic surface. What I aim to do in these
      two chapters is to explore how Vergil is engaging with the monumental
      discourse of Augustan Rome through a poem whose surface might be as
      resplendent as a Roman temple, but whose interior hides a chaotic force
      that should not be forgotten lest it break free and cause the past to
      repeat itself. A return to the <em>Res Gestae</em> at the end of Chapter V will
      set in further relief how Augustus dealt in his own monumental discourse
      with the <em>furor</em> and chaos of Rome&#x2019;s past which he too needed to contain
      when attempting to construct a new Roman <em>constitutio</em>.</p>
      
      <p>In Chapter VI, as the dissertation itself approaches its end, I will
      then examine the conclusion of another &#x201C;epic&#x201D; poem, Ovid&#x2019;s
      <em>Metamorphoses</em>, to see how a poet writing at the far end of the
      Augustan age further explores the ideas of stability and instability in
      the monumental edifices examined in Horatian lyric and Vergilian epic,
      respectively. The metaphor of a poem as a <em>monumentum</em> may have begun to
      run its course as something fresh and dynamic by the conclusion of the
      Augustan age. As I will argue, however, Ovid&#x2019;s poem represents not the
      dying of this architectural metaphor but rather its evolution to reflect
      the way in which Augustus himself had re-arranged the boundaries which
      had structured Roman space and Roman identity during Rome&#x2019;s rise to
      power. The late Augustan poet concludes his <em>Metamorphoses</em> as Horace
      does in his <em>Odes</em>, namely, by claiming that he too has constructed a
      monument.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Ovid&#x2019;s structure is rather different from that of his
      Augustan predecessor, however. Like the content of his poem itself, in
      fact, the monument that Ovid has constructed seems to transcend its own
      boundaries, that is, to become a structure without a structure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> I
      argue that this transcendence of structure mirrors the way that the
      boundaries between public and private space also fade away in the final
      chapter of <em>Res Gestae</em>. It might be, in fact, that the most important
      &#x201C;construction&#x201D; that Augustus completed was not just to build a new <em>res
      publica</em> without destabilizing the foundations of the past, as Horace
      does with his <em>monumentum</em>. Nor was it to give a frame to a new
      understanding of what it meant to be Roman while keeping the horrors of
      the past present, as Vergil accomplishes in his poem. Even more
      important perhaps was how the <em>princeps</em> carefully articulated his own
      constructions in the <em>Res Gestae</em> as a means of radically renegotiating
      the boundaries between his property and that of the state.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>My conclusion in Chapter VII will look to the broader consequences of
      what an analysis of this &#x201C;dialogue&#x201D; between the poets and <em>princeps</em> can
      teach us about monumentality today. I will provide a brief survey of the
      idea of the monument in modernity in order to show by way of contrast
      that the various ways which the Romans embraced the dual nature of
      monuments to be both stable and unstable might just provide a more
      productive alternative to the at times rather limiting discourse
      surrounding modern monumentality.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Let us now return for a moment, though, to the words that began this
      introduction: &#x201C;I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as
      a city of brick.&#x201D; This boast is more nuanced than it might first appear.
      The <em>princeps</em> is not claiming to have knocked down Rome and replaced it
      with something new. Even if the material is different, the <em>structure</em>
      is importantly still the same. Rome is still Rome &#x2013; and its ancient
      foundations lie untouched. This is not by chance. Augustus was
      incredibly careful with his use of monumental discourse to articulate
      the Rome that he (re-)constructed. And this dissertation will attempt to
      suggest why.</p>

      even city planning&#x201D; (6). The <em>Res Gestae</em> itself has been the topic
      of much recent scholarship concerning the way Augustus&#x2019; inscribed
      &#x201C;autobiography&#x201D; helped fashion a particular image of the <em>princeps</em>
      and the Augustan age, including Ramage 1987, Ridley 2003, Cooley
      2009, 1-43. See also Stuart 1905, 429-440, for an outdated but still
      useful examination of Augustus&#x2019; inscriptional practices when it
      comes to the monuments of the period, and Syme 1939, 520-524,
      presenting an insightful (though perhaps overly hostile) account of
      the rhetorical stance that Augustus takes up in the <em>Res Gestae</em>. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>Although classicists have treated the &#x201C;discourse of monumentality&#x201D;
      in the ancient world previously, an application to the poetry of the
      Augustan age is largely lacking. Although Elsner 1994 presents a
      useful overview of how the discourse functions in ancient historians
      from Herodotus to Pausanias, the approach most similar to mine can
      be found in Fowler 2000, 193-219. His discussion of the very thin
      line between &#x201C;monument&#x201D; and &#x201C;ruin&#x201D; has been particularly influential

            <p>The idea that architectural discourse was an important one in late
      republican and Augustan literature is by no means novel. Mazzolini
      1970, Ceau&#x1E63;escu 1976, and Labate 1991 each treats the impact that
      the idea of Rome as a city had on Roman thought. F. R. Brown 1963,
      Gros 1991, Callebat 1994, Caye 2011, and now Elsner and Meyer 2014,
      35-114, all tackle the complex nexus of architecture and rhetoric.
      Whereas Edwards 1996 present the &#x201C;Romes&#x201D; that texts of several eras
      have fashioned, Reitz 2013 argues &#x201C;that describing the process of
      (architectural) construction within a literary text can also be a
      way of encouraging the reader to consider the (literary)
      construction of the text itself&#x201D; (8). Moreover, several excellent
      and detailed studies have attempted to find meaning in architecture
      that goes beyond the physical structures within the works of Cicero,
      Livy, and Vitruvius, including Vasaly 1993, on Cicero&#x2019;s manipulation
      of monuments in his oratory, Jaegar 1997, on how Livy uses monuments
      &#x2013; both within and including his own work &#x2013; to construct a Rome for
