    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>The Augustan age provides a particularly useful lens through which to
      examine the idea of the monument. It represented a relatively short
      period of time in which Romans witnessed the monumental make-over of
      their city, their government, and even what it meant to be Roman.
      Building was on the minds of many Romans during Augustus&#x2019; reign. The
      poets and writers of the period are famous for constru(ct)ing their
      works as buildings or monuments of some sort. Livy and Horace have their
      own <em>monumenta</em>. Vergil his <em>templum</em>. Ovid has his <em>opus</em>. Might
      Augustus have thought of his work in Rome in such architectural terms?
      &#x2026;<em>rei publicae constituendae</em>&#x2026;<sup id="fnref:475"><a href="#fn:475" class="footnote">1</a></sup> That was the task that Augustus
      took up when he first came into power. He did not do it alone, though.
      There were also the Augustan poets who contributed to his
      monumentalization of Rome with their own <em>monumenta</em> &#x2013; poets who helped
      Romans to become better readers of the structures around them, both
      physical and metaphorical.</p>
      
      <p>To conclude this dissertation I will now turn to the situation of the
      monument in modernity. By outlining some of the ways that the idea of
      the monument has been viewed in modern times I hope demonstrate by way
      of contrast just how productive the Roman understanding of monumentality
      was in Augustan Rome. The below rather concise history of monumentality
      in modernity is not the only story that one could tell about the idea of
      the monument in the 18<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries. It is a cursory review,
      not a comprehensive study, and several important players and moments in
      the debate simply had to be left out for the sake of concision. My aim
      in looking now at more recent times is rather to demonstrate how the
      concept of monumentality in the Augustan age was a fruitful response to
      some of the same issues which we deal with today when we think of the
      structures around us &#x2013; both in our physical reality and in the way they
      help us to frame how we see the world in which we live.</p>
      
      <p>&#x201C;The Death of the Monument.&#x201D; With this bold title Lewis Mumford famously
      announced the fall of monumental architecture in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.
      What was the cause of its demise? Death by &#x201C;contradiction.&#x201D; That was
      Mumford&#x2019;s initial diagnosis, at least.<sup id="fnref:476"><a href="#fn:476" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The idea of the monument &#x2013;
      an object &#x201C;oriented toward death and fixity&#x201D; &#x2013; simply did not fit any
      conception of modern architecture, which for Mumford stressed &#x201C;life and
      change.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:477"><a href="#fn:477" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The very stone materials that had so long been endowed
      with &#x201C;a metaphysical belief in fixity and immortality&#x201D; now became
      dangerous &#x201C;encumbrances&#x201D; in Mumford&#x2019;s eyes: monumental structures
      &#x201C;stifle the possibilities of adaptation, movement and effective
      improvement&#x201D; &#x2013; and for that reason, Mumford warned, they might even
      bring about civilization&#x2019;s &#x201C;ultimate downfall.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:478"><a href="#fn:478" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This was not the first time that the death knell had sounded for the
      monument. Nor would it be the last. The monument had died and would
      continue to &#x201C;die&#x201D; in modern thought &#x2013; whether as a symbol of past
      traditions, as a physical structure erected to represent present powers,
      or as a metaphor operative in giving structure to the ways in which we
      think about thinking. This conclusion will examine three &#x201C;deaths&#x201D; of the
      modern monument in particular, each time with an eye to the different
      conclusions of this dissertation regarding the idea of the monument in
      Augustan Rome. Although the Romans faced some of the same issues with
      the nature of the monument, especially in regards to its physical and
      epistemological instability, this study has suggested that these
      anxieties did not lead to the collapse of the idea but rather its
      reconstruction &#x2013; and with it the reconstruction of Roman society after
      years of civil strife and political disillusionment.</p>

      <p>&#x201C;Let there be no mistake,&#x201D; Victor Hugo wrote in his <em>Notre-Dame de
      Paris</em> (1831), &#x201C;architecture is dead.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:479"><a href="#fn:479" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The culprit this time?
      Gutenburg&#x2019;s printing press, according to Hugo, which had given everyone
      the ability to build (metaphorically) his or her own grand edifice of
      knowledge that the church and palace had once represented.<sup id="fnref:480"><a href="#fn:480" class="footnote">6</a></sup> As a
      result, it has been argued, grand architecture began to lose the
      symbolic authority that it had possessed when it was closely bound to
      the ideas of the sacred and the royal before finally dying with the fall
      of the <em>Ancien R&#xE9;gime</em> and the questioning of all the power structures
      that it had represented.<sup id="fnref:481"><a href="#fn:481" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The French Revolution had also stripped monuments of the ability to make
      material the binding structure of past authority. Indeed, while Henri
      L&#xE9;onard Jean Baptiste Bertin (1720-1792) as Louis XV&#x2019;s <em>contr&#xF4;leur
      g&#xE9;n&#xE9;ral des finances</em> wrote to his king that &#x201C;[t]he history and public
      law of a nation are based on its monuments,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:482"><a href="#fn:482" class="footnote">8</a></sup> the aftermath of
      French Revolution with its wish to produce a radical break from the
      structures of the past produced a rather different attitude towards
      monuments: the past that grand architecture commemorated was a lost (and
      undesirable) past;<sup id="fnref:483"><a href="#fn:483" class="footnote">9</a></sup> it was rather the new needs of the present and
      future that monuments should address.<sup id="fnref:484"><a href="#fn:484" class="footnote">10</a></sup> And while there were
      certainly attempts by those like the English art critic, John Ruskin, to
      save the monuments of the past and the authority they could
      materialize,<sup id="fnref:485"><a href="#fn:485" class="footnote">11</a></sup> the ancient structures that did exist came to be seen
      with a more questioning eye by historians, even once the strong desire
      for &#x201C;rupture&#x201D; from the past had subsided.<sup id="fnref:486"><a href="#fn:486" class="footnote">12</a></sup> To Fustel de Coulanges
      at the end of the nineteenth century, for example, it was the &#x201C;document&#x201D;
      &#x2013; and specifically <em>not</em> the &#x201C;monument&#x201D;&#x2013; that became our tie to the
      &#x201C;truth&#x201D; of the past.<sup id="fnref:487"><a href="#fn:487" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Already in the nineteenth century, then, it is possible to detect a
      version of what Mumford would call a &#x201C;distrust for the monumental&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:488"><a href="#fn:488" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
      &#x2013; not only in the inability of monuments to produce the same kind of awe
      that they once had done for the church and traditions of the past, but
      also in the failure of these structure to create for humanity a stable
      link to that past. The collapse of the power structures of church and
      state revealed what seemed to be a flaw in the nature of the monument,
      namely, its inability to endure once the link between it and the
      figurative structure of the state had been severed. Structures fade away
      over time. And those structures that had once been symbols of power were
      now symbols of that very power&#x2019;s collapse.</p>
      
      <p>The Romans at the beginning of the Augustan age did not abandon the
      structures of their past, whether real or figurative; they rebuilt them,
      rather, despite the narrative of the Roman state&#x2019;s &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; at the end
      of the republic, as voiced in authors such as Livy and Horace.<sup id="fnref:489"><a href="#fn:489" class="footnote">15</a></sup>
      These new structures were built upon past foundations, so to speak, but
      used the stability offered by monumentality to balance innovations
      against the previous structures of Rome&#x2019;s history. Horace did this with
      his <em>Odes</em> by constructing a poetic <em>monumentum</em> that was lyric but also
      incorporated forces that might seem to upset its generic framework. In
      this way, as I argued in Chapter III, the poet crafted a work whose
      generic tensions allowed for a constantly dynamic structure that was at
      once traditional and innovative &#x2013; one that would breathe new life into
      an old structure. Augustus in his <em>Res Gestae</em> also employed a similar
      rhetorical strategy in describing his own building activities to
      articulate the novel kind of power that he had fashioned for himself
      without destabilizing the traditional boundaries of Rome&#x2019;s political and
      cultural past. It was just as much in downplaying the radical nature of
      his works as in stressing their magnificence that allowed the emperor to
      incorporate new ideas and structures within traditional republican
      boundaries without seeming to break them down even further. Neither
      Horace nor Augustus shied away from employing the power of monuments &#x2013;
      and the idea of a dynamic structure that they provide &#x2013; even at a time
      when the old monuments of Rome that represented the <em>res publica</em> were
      in ruin. In short, both the poet and the <em>princeps</em> saw the advantages
      to employing such structures of the past, if only because it allowed
      them to articulate delicately the innovations which they made to those
      structures&#x2019; traditional frames.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-2-the-second-death-shaking-the-foundations-of-present-authority">Part 2. The Second &#x201C;Death&#x201D;: Shaking the Foundations of Present Authority</h3>
      
      <p>Let us return briefly now to Mumford and his autopsy of the monument&#x2019;s
      &#x201C;corpse.&#x201D; A closer look at his essay reveals that modernism was not the
      sole cause of death. &#x201C;[E]very stone has become ironic to us,&#x201D; Mumford
      noted. &#x201C;[T]ime is a bomb that will split the most august temple open,
      if the wanton savagery of men&#x2019;s swifter bombs does not anticipate
      time.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:490"><a href="#fn:490" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Faith in present monuments still did exist for the moment,
      though, as the ability to create secular monuments fell to the people of
      the French Revolution and its aftermath. However, the doubt that had
      adhered to monuments of the past eventually &#x2013; and in a certain sense
      inevitably &#x2013; also began to enter into people&#x2019;s thoughts concerning
      monuments of their present, as well as those of their future. In the
      aftermath of one World War and at the cusp of yet another there was a
      certain awareness of the fragility of mankind&#x2019;s affairs and structures.
      And this &#x201C;distrust for the monumental,&#x201D; as Mumford put it, would only
      increase following WWII when the atrocities of that war produced
      monuments that &#x201C;stopped celebrating great deeds, as their specialty
      [was] to register grave errors.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:491"><a href="#fn:491" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>A transformation of the monumental to commemorate what one might wish
      had never happened was not the only blow to the West&#x2019;s faith in
      monumentality that WWII delivered. The grand building projects of
      Mussolini and Hitler each left their own impact on the idea of the
      monument. The desire of <em>Il Duce</em> to remake Rome &#x201C;vast, ordered,
      powerful, as it was in the time of the first empire of Augustus,&#x201D; had
      led to several monumental building projects in Rome that integrated or
      directly called upon Roman monuments in an attempt to capitalize on the
      imperial monumentality of the Augustan age itself.<sup id="fnref:492"><a href="#fn:492" class="footnote">18</a></sup> There was the
      dangerous belief among Mussolini&#x2019;s followers, moreover, that these
      projects legitimated his plans for domination of the
      Mediterranean.<sup id="fnref:493"><a href="#fn:493" class="footnote">19</a></sup> The Italian art historian Gustavo Giovannini would
      go so far as to proclaim that &#x201C;[w]hile the Empire returns to the fated
      hills of Rome and new glories join themselves with the ancient ones,
      from our hearts comes the vow that architecture of the Fascist times
      will resume &#x2013; in the return to our grand tradition &#x2013; the path of
      domination which was that of the past.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:494"><a href="#fn:494" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Yet this was all relatively tame compared to the vast (and utterly
      intrusive) building programs that Hitler was planning in Northern
      Europe.<sup id="fnref:495"><a href="#fn:495" class="footnote">21</a></sup> To reclaim the monuments and monumentality of imperial
      Rome for his own use was not so easy a task in Germany as it was for
      Mussolini in Rome. Hitler&#x2019;s strategy had to be different. As the famous
      German architectural theorist L&#xE9;on Krier would later say, Hitler sought
      not merely to &#x201C;copy historic styles, but to create a new style which was
      itself to become historical&#x201D; &#x2013; one that far surpassed the &#x201C;coarse
      Latinism of Italian Fascism.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:496"><a href="#fn:496" class="footnote">22</a></sup> The goal was not imitation of Roman
      monumental architecture, <em>per se</em>, but of its high degree of sheer
      monumentality.<sup id="fnref:497"><a href="#fn:497" class="footnote">23</a></sup> &#x201C;[I]t was gigantic proportions,&#x201D; then, and &#x201C;not
      purity of style, that interested Hitler.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:498"><a href="#fn:498" class="footnote">24</a></sup> More importantly,
      though, it was an obsession with using his buildings to create a message
      that would &#x2013; according to his chief architect Albert Speer &#x2013; &#x201C;deliver
      his time and its spirit to posterity.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:499"><a href="#fn:499" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It would have no doubt been enough to make people wary of monuments if
      Mussolini and Hitler had succeeded in their architectural
      endeavors.<sup id="fnref:500"><a href="#fn:500" class="footnote">26</a></sup> The fact that they failed, however, that their
      buildings and building projects came to be judged as &#x201C;colossal
      mistakes,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:501"><a href="#fn:501" class="footnote">27</a></sup> would create a further distrust in the idea of the
      monument by reinforcing the emptiness, fragility, and instability of the
      meaning of monuments both ancient and modern. Just consider, for
      instance, whether there could ever be another Lincoln Memorial in
      America, or another face added to Mt. Rushmore. No matter how great a
      president might be, I would argue, the very idea of erecting such a
      monument to him or her has become almost inconceivable today.</p>
      
      <p>As Chapters IV and V demonstrated, however, the &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of a monument
      to maintain a single, triumphant narrative can be just as useful as its
      success for making a viewer think about the past and its relation to him
      or her. Vergil again and again show the inability of monuments, whether
      old or new, to serve as epistemological ballasts. However, the ability
      of a monument to have multiple meanings does not necessarily render it
      any less useful &#x2013; whether for the poet or Augustus himself. For the
      Augustan peace to have its full significance, I argued above, it was
      necessary for Romans to see beyond the monumental frame of their city to
      the chaotic past that existed beneath the marble facade. <em>Furor</em> had
      been bound and chained by Augustus, it is true, but that did mean it was
      gone forever. And Augustus needed his subjects to remember that, too.
      Vergil helps to craft readers who can appreciate the beauty and
      magnificence of the surface of Augustan monuments while remembering the
      violent and chaotic past that such monuments try to frame and contain.
      Far from &#x201C;deconstructing&#x201D; the positive message of a monumental structure
      both Vergil and Augustus used the epistemological &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of monuments
      to establish an even deeper appreciation of the new and improved present
      within the Roman imagination.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-3-the-third-death-the-collapse-of-the-monumental-metaphor">Part 3. The Third &#x201C;Death&#x201D;: The Collapse of the Monumental Metaphor</h3>
      
      <p>The idea of the monument was first killed in modernity when the
      loosening of authority that the printing press had set in motion began
      to shatter the power structures of the past (as well as the monuments
      that materialized them) in the revolutionary air of the late eighteenth
      century. It was at this time, however, that the idea of monument was
      reborn as a monumentality geared to the present and future &#x2013; only to die
      again, though, when its stability (physical and epistemological) was
      revealed to be a farce by the World Wars that shook humanity to its
      foundations.<sup id="fnref:502"><a href="#fn:502" class="footnote">28</a></sup> It was not long afterwards that Roland Barthes would
      write in his important essay on <em>La Tour Eiffel</em> (1964) that the famous
      French edifice was an &#x201C;empty monument&#x201D; (<em>monument vide</em>) &#x2013; one that was
      &#x201C;impossible to escape, <em>because it means everything&#x201D;</em> and yet also
      &#x201C;<em>nothing</em>&#x201D; in that &#x201C;it achieves a kind of zero degree of the
      monument.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:503"><a href="#fn:503" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Such a point had been reached, in other words, when the
      physical monument which had once been the chief symbol of humanity for
      representing authority past and present was now a representation of the
      problems with representing any idea &#x2013; including not least of all
      representation itself.</p>
      
      <p>The possibility of an &#x201C;empty&#x201D; monument that Barthes raised has
      additional significance for the discussion of modern monumentality. The
      monument was not just an important signifier for the traditions of the
      past and power structures of the present; it had been from the start
      perhaps one of the fundamental metaphors for &#x201C;thinking about thinking&#x201D;
      in the West.<sup id="fnref:504"><a href="#fn:504" class="footnote">30</a></sup> The above narrative regarding the &#x201C;death&#x201D; of physical
      monuments runs parallel to another history concerning the demise of
      metaphorical ones in the context of (the aptly named) post-structuralism
      and, in particular, the theories and practices of deconstruction.</p>
      
      <p>Majestic architecture had always been &#x2013; in the words of Hugo &#x2013; the
      &#x201C;grand book of humanity.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:505"><a href="#fn:505" class="footnote">31</a></sup> A strange thing happened, though, when
      the physical monument began to lose its power as the Ur-symbol, as
      discussed above with its first two &#x201C;deaths.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:506"><a href="#fn:506" class="footnote">32</a></sup> If anything, in fact,
      losing its physical nature seems to have allowed the architectural
      monument to gain additional power as a metaphor. Just at the point when
      architecture ceased to be the universal text of humanity in Hugo&#x2019;s text,
      for instance, text became humanity&#x2019;s universal architecture.<sup id="fnref:507"><a href="#fn:507" class="footnote">33</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Hugo was not alone in carrying the discourse surrounding architecture
      and monuments into the text. Kant had already erected his famous
      &#x201C;edifice of metaphysics&#x201D; in the <em>Kritik der Urteilskraft</em> near the very
      start of the French Revolution in 1790.<sup id="fnref:508"><a href="#fn:508" class="footnote">34</a></sup> As this transformation
      continued, moreover, the removal of the monument from history (and
      historiography) proved harder than Fustel de Coulanges and others would
      have liked. Nietzsche would claim that we need a sense of the
      &#x201C;monumental&#x201D; in our history &#x2013; despite its many dangers<sup id="fnref:509"><a href="#fn:509" class="footnote">35</a></sup> &#x2013; if we are
      to learn anything at all from the past and not be severed from it
      entirely.<sup id="fnref:510"><a href="#fn:510" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Foucault writing over a hundred years afterwards might
      have put it best, though, when he noted that whereas history used to
      turn monuments into documents the opposite had occurred in his own time:
      historians now make documents into monuments.<sup id="fnref:511"><a href="#fn:511" class="footnote">37</a></sup> It had become clear,
      in other words, that documents of the past are in essence fashioned just
      like monuments &#x2013; and thereby are open to the same dangers of
      interpretation.<sup id="fnref:512"><a href="#fn:512" class="footnote">38</a></sup> It might not be a coincidence, then, that it was
      in this particular intellectual milieu in which Barthes and Foucault
      were writing &#x2013; when the monument had died, lost the power of its
      materiality, and been reborn in the text &#x2013; that post-structuralism came
      to prominence.</p>
      
      <p>The monument would &#x201C;die&#x201D; once again in this context, of course. The
      executioner this time would be none other than the theories and
      practices of deconstruction. The transformation of the monument from a
      physical building in reality into a metaphorical one in the text had
      left the latter vulnerable to the same instabilities that had been noted
      in the former. Kant&#x2019;s worst anxieties thus came to fruition: the
      foundations of his edifice of metaphysics were seen to be just as
      susceptible to failure as any real building &#x2013; and with their cracking
      would come &#x201C;the collapse of the whole structure.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:513"><a href="#fn:513" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Indeed, as the
      Japanese cultural critic Kojin Karatani would put it, the desire of Kant
      (and much Western philosophy) &#x201C;&#x2018;to construct a solid edifice&#x2019; ultimately
      does not achieve a foundation, but reveals instead the very absence of
      its own foundation.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:514"><a href="#fn:514" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Western thought cannot but undermine itself,
      according to Karatani, as the very will &#x201C;to establish order and
      structure within a chaotic and manifold becoming&#x201D; betrays the fact that
      the order is not only constructed, but also subject to collapsing back
      into the chaos it masks.<sup id="fnref:515"><a href="#fn:515" class="footnote">41</a></sup> It would seem, in fact, that this third
      death of the monument &#x2013; that is, the collapse of the grand metaphorical
      edifice of Western philosophy which was supposed to provide stability
      and fixity for all thought &#x2013; was perhaps not an insignificant factor for
      the strength of deconstructive discourse itself over the past few
      decades.</p>
      
      <p>This modern response is one way to come to grips with the
      acknowledgement that monuments are inherently unstable, as physical
      structures and as metaphors. But what if one decided to embrace fully
      the malleability of meaning inherent to the structural metaphor of a
      monument? What if one used that same instability to enlist one&#x2019;s
      audience in validating and stabilizing that new structure whatever it
      may be? Would that not allow one to erect something that can transcend
      the traditional boundaries that limit one&#x2019;s potential to create
      something new and innovative? Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorphoses</em> perhaps gives us an
      answer to these sorts of questions. The very lack of structure in his
      architextural monument allows him at the end of his text to craft a poem
      that achieves its power not by establishing a solid edifice; the power
      of the <em>Metamorphoses</em> lies rather in the way that it asks its audience
      to establish firmly the open and ever-changing nature of the work. It
      was by these means, as Chapter VI suggested, that Ovid could make his
      private self a permanent part of the public consciousness and transcend
      the physical limits of his body &#x2013; all while also helping to shape
      through his poem how the Roman public understood what it now meant to be
      Roman in a new age. Augustus&#x2019; monumentalization of Rome represented a
      similar response to the opening up of boundaries that his reign had
      produced: the <em>princeps</em> at the end of his <em>Res Gestae</em> broke down and
      reconstructed the republican boundaries of private and public in such a
      way that he too could have his subjects themselves become partners in
      establishing a new frame for structuring Rome and Roman identity.
      Neither poet nor <em>princeps</em> might have been quite so successful, though,
      if each had not embraced the inherent epistemological instability of
      architectural discourse when articulating how they had reshaped Roman
      space and through it Roman identity. They were not afraid to let their
      audiences give the final meaning to their monuments; in fact, that very
      well may have been the secret to their subsequent immortality.</p>
      
      <p>***</p>
      
      <p>&#x201C;Remember the impression of good architecture, that it expresses a
      thought,&#x201D; Ludwig Wittgenstein once wrote. &#x201C;You want to respond to it
      with a gesture.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:516"><a href="#fn:516" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Augustus might have opened up the dialogue by
      making Rome a city of marble. He needed people who could &#x201C;respond&#x201D; to
      him, however, especially since the meaning of his monumental structures
      and their relation to what it meant to be Roman was often far from
      unambiguous. Nor could they be otherwise when the <em>princeps</em> had to be
      careful to establish his new Rome upon what Rome had been &#x2013; both in good
      times and bad. The Augustan poets in turn investigated the monumentality
      of their age through their own monumental poems. This dissertation has
      suggested that their <em>monumenta</em> entered into a dialogue with the
      monumentalization of their city, shaping it and being shaped by it. They
      not only built monuments that would last even longer than that of the
      <em>princeps</em>; more than that, the self-reflective nature of their
      monuments made explicit the assumptions of the dialogue itself &#x2013; and
      thus opened it up as a dialogue in which any Roman reader could
      critically engage.</p>
      
      <p>What about those readers? The Roman people themselves played an
      essential part in responding to the architectural gestures of the
      <em>princeps</em> and thereby giving meaning to the structures of their
      existence. And in closing this dissertation I want to look at <em>this</em>
      dialogue in the context of one final architextural passage &#x2013; this time
      from Augustus himself. In an edict recorded by Suetonius, the <em>princeps</em>
      claimed:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Ita mihi <strong>salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere in sua sede</strong> liceat
      atque eius rei fructum percipere, quem peto, ut <strong>optimi status auctor
      dicar</strong> et moriens ut feram mecum spem, <strong>mansura in vestigio suo
      fundamenta rei p. quae iecero</strong>. (<em>Div</em>. <em>Aug</em>. 28.2)<sup id="fnref:517"><a href="#fn:517" class="footnote">43</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>May it thus be permitted for me <strong>to establish in its place the <em>res
      publica</em> securely and soundly</strong>, and to reap from that action the
      fruit that I&#xA0;seek, on the condition that <strong>I&#xA0;may be called</strong> <strong>the
      architect of the best state</strong>, and that when I die I may carry with me
      the hope that <strong>the foundations of the <em>res publica</em> which I&#xA0;have set
      will remain in its position</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Suetonius adds that Augustus &#x201C;himself granted his own wish by striving
      in every way that there be no dissatisfaction with the new state&#x201D;
      (<em>fecitque ipse se compotem voti nisus omni modo, ne quem novi status
      paeniteret</em>, <em>Div. Aug</em>. 28.2). Although Suetonius might be right here
      about the political situation, his interpretation completely misses the
      importance of the architectural metaphors at play in Augustus&#x2019; statement
      (cf. <em>salvam ac sospitem rem p. sistere</em> <em>in sua sede &#x2026; mansura in
      vestigio suo fundamenta rei p. quae iecero</em>). Architectural meaning
      cannot be established by a top-down approach &#x2013; neither in the case of
      physical buildings nor with the structure of the <em>res publica</em> itself.
      Augustus seems to have understood that notion better than the average
      leader, whether in antiquity or today. And it was in allowing the Roman
      people to be a part of the dialogue that monumental architecture opens
      up &#x2013; whether in stone or in word &#x2013; that was just as important to making
      sure he would in fact be called the &#x201C;architect of the best state&#x201D;
      (<em>optimi status auctor dicar</em>) by his subjects.<sup id="fnref:518"><a href="#fn:518" class="footnote">44</a></sup> For it was by
      leaving it to the Romans themselves to validate the new <em>status</em> that
      the <em>princeps</em> could ensure his monument of the city itself (and what it
      now meant) would remain standing in place long after he had died.</p>
      
      <p>It was much to Augustus&#x2019; advantage, then, that there were contemporary
      poets whose self-reflective <em>monumenta</em> could provide lessons in the
      nature of monumentality. Horace, Vergil, and Ovid each brought out
      different aspects of monumentality, its weaknesses as well as its
      strengths, with the understanding that monuments were structures which
      were inherently (and paradoxically) both stable and unstable,
      epistemologically and much as physically. This was not a harsh critique
      of what Augustus was doing in reality. Nor was it merely a game, either,
      that paralleled a loss of faith in the meaning of structures that had
      framed Roman existence in the aftermath of the republic&#x2019;s supposed
      &#x201C;collapse.&#x201D; It was rather in part because of these poets that the Roman
      people could fully understand why the monumental <em>constitutio</em> that
      Augustus had built was the best that Rome had ever seen &#x2013; and, even more
      importantly, that it ultimately could not stand for very long without
      their consent.</p>

            <p>As Demandt 1982, 59, notes, Hitler also &#x201C;thought of himself as
      architect&#x201D; (<em>sich selbst als Architekt empfand</em>) &#x2013; and saw building
      as an important part of his cultural program. Indeed, according to
      Scobie 1990, 37, one of the messages of Hitler&#x2019;s <em>Mein Kampf</em> was
      &#x201C;that industrialized German cities of his own day lacked dominating
      public monuments and a central focus for community life.&#x201D; As Scobie
      goes on to show, moreover, Hitler would address this &#x201C;problem&#x201D; in a
      rather significant way in several German towns and cities by
      building his own monuments &#x2013; without much concern, of course, for
      whatever older buildings were in his way. <a href="#fnref:495" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

      and Carpo 2007, 54, where the scholar argues that &#x201C;[m]onuments can
      no longer point to the future because the postmodern construction of
      history does not provide one, or it provides too many. Historical
      monuments have no place in posthistorical times.&#x201D; This way of
      thought regarding the future finds a major proponent with Nora 1989,
      17, where the French historian maintains that &#x201C;[s]ince no one
      knows what the past will be made of next, anxiety turns everything
      into a trace, a possible indication, a hint of history that
      contaminates the innocence of all things.&#x201D; Nora sees this problem,
      in other words, as resulting in the birth of a new kind of monument,
      <em>les lieux de memoire</em>, which are &#x201C;fundamentally remains, the
      ultimate embodiments of a memorial consciousness that has barely
      survived in a historical age that calls out for memory because it

      the language he uses to speak of text here (and elsewhere towards
      the end of the chapter) that such a transformation has in fact
      occurred &#x2013; and, more importantly, that architecture has been reborn
      as a metaphor in a form that is just as or even more potent. Indeed,

      past, to transform them into <em>documents,</em> and to make speak those
      traces that, in themselves, are often not verbal, or that say in
