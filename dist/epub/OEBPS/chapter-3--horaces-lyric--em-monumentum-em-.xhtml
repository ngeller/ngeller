    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3. Horace&#x2019;s Lyric <em>Monumentum</em></h2>
    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>Horace is a poet of structure.<sup id="fnref:120"><a href="#fn:120" class="footnote">1</a></sup> And no more so than in his <em>Odes</em>.
      Scholars again and again refer to his poems using architectural
      vocabulary.<sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It is almost more of a surprise, in fact, when a
      scholar of Horace does <em>not</em> discuss the &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of an individual
      poem, of a single book, or of the collection as a whole. This sense of
      structure can include the more literal way that different poems are
      arranged within and between themselves, that is, the &#x201C;architectonics&#x201D; of
      Horace&#x2019;s poetry. The idea of structure can also extend beyond this
      organizational sense, though, to the more metaphorical ways in which
      Horace has &#x201C;constructed&#x201D; his <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote">3</a></sup> In Gregson Davis&#x2019; study of
      the complexities of the Horatian lyric voice, for instance, he considers
      the <em>Odes</em> to be &#x201C;an ideational building, which it is part of the
      business of the critic to reconstruct.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:123"><a href="#fn:123" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This use of architectural discourse to discuss Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em> is no
      accident. The poet himself famously proclaims his first collection of
      lyric poetry to be a <em>monumentum</em> &#x2013; one higher than the pyramids no less
      &#x2013; and this image has influenced how readers (and scholars) thereafter
      have understood and imagined the <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote">5</a></sup> This chapter will look at
      the &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of the <em>Odes</em>, too, but not in the sense of a lyric
      collection with a brilliant design of lines, poems, and books. Nor will
      I be using architectural metaphors only to introduce or summarize &#x2013; as
      Davis does &#x2013; how I as a scholar of the <em>Odes</em> might read Horace&#x2019;s lyric
      corpus. The focus of this chapter is rather to examine Horace&#x2019;s
      architexture, that is, the architectural imagery that the poet himself
      employs to represent the generic limits of his poetry. The point of this
      analysis is not merely to admire or praise Horace&#x2019;s amazing &#x201C;structure,&#x201D;
      as so many rightly have. I aim rather to show how engaging in
      architectural discourse of this sort allows the poet to redefine
      &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric space and time in a way that puts him in dialogue
      with Augustus&#x2019; own redefinition of traditional Roman structures in the
      language of the <em>Res Gestae</em>.</p>
      
      <p>What is &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric time and space in the <em>Odes</em>? It is not
      simply the dimensions that Horace&#x2019;s lyric predecessors, Greek and Roman,
      had crafted in their poems. Horace was starting fresh in the sense that
      when he &#x201C;decided to compose lyric, despite experimentation by
      Callimachus, Theocritus, Laevius, and Catullus,<sup id="fnref:125"><a href="#fn:125" class="footnote">6</a></sup> the kind was dead,
      that is, there was no living tradition of lyric to generate some sort of
      &#x2018;natural,&#x2019; rule-generating form.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:126"><a href="#fn:126" class="footnote">7</a></sup> What counted as &#x201C;traditional&#x201D;
      was therefore open to interpretation and debate &#x2013; just as it was in the
      politics and culture of the Augustan age more broadly.<sup id="fnref:127"><a href="#fn:127" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Horace
      defined the spatio-temporal limits of his lyric not so much with an eye
      to past lyric, I would argue, as with an ear to the discourse regarding
      the redefinition of traditional Roman structures in his present. In what
      I will suggest was a particularly Augustan move the poet built his lyric
      structure to be simultaneously &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; <em>and</em> innovative enough to
      have extrageneric material as part of its definition. As this chapter
      will demonstrate, moreover, Horace accomplished this seemingly
      paradoxical construction through a delicate balancing of apparent
      opposites to be in perfect tension with each other: the private,
      personal <em>hic et nunc</em> (&#x201C;here and now&#x201D;) of his lyric, on the one hand,
      and the public, political dimensions of epic that he claims are
      unfitting for his lyre, on the other.<sup id="fnref:128"><a href="#fn:128" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Therefore, while Horace&#x2019;s Greek lyric predecessors are important to his
      <em>Odes</em>,<sup id="fnref:129"><a href="#fn:129" class="footnote">10</a></sup> and their poetry forms the basis for many of the poems
      (and their meters) in the corpus,<sup id="fnref:130"><a href="#fn:130" class="footnote">11</a></sup> I will not be looking directly
      at their influence for the present analysis. Horace was engaging in a
      poetic enterprise which was radically different from any that his
      precursors, Greek or Roman, had attempted in this poems<sup id="fnref:131"><a href="#fn:131" class="footnote">12</a></sup> &#x2013; an
      enterprise that was very much in tune with his own moment in Augustan
      Rome. As Paul Allen Miller puts it, &#x201C;[t]he creation of a private
      poetry which ultimately engages the public realm, without becoming the
      discourse of the state, requires the presence of&#x2026; [a] set of social,
      technological, and political conditions which separates Horace&#x2019;s world
      from that of his Lesbian predecessors.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:132"><a href="#fn:132" class="footnote">13</a></sup> This chapter will show how
      Horace&#x2019;s architexture reflects these particular &#x201C;conditions&#x201D; in the way
      it redefines traditional lyric space and time to include extrageneric
      (especially epic) material which might seem inappropriate or even
      opposed to it.</p>
      
      <p>This particular opposition between traditional lyric dimensions and the
      extrageneric ones of epic is given concrete form in the <em>Odes</em> through a
      specific juxtaposition of contrasting architectural structures. Horace&#x2019;s
      traditional lyric space-time is represented often by the figure of the
      poet&#x2019;s own Sabine farm<sup id="fnref:133"><a href="#fn:133" class="footnote">14</a></sup> &#x2013; a modest dwelling from a simpler time
      that seems perfect for housing the self-proclaimed Callimachean nature
      of his lyric.<sup id="fnref:134"><a href="#fn:134" class="footnote">15</a></sup> In contrast to this humble structure of the poet
      stands the excessively luxurious, expansive, and &#x201C;modern&#x201D; (cf.
      <em>novo&#x2026;ritu</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.1.45-46) villas of the Roman elite that appear in
      many poems of the corpus but receive special attention in <em>C</em>. 2.18 and
      3.1. Horace warns again and again against building such edifices: they
      cause their owners, the poet implies, to lose a sense of the lyric here
      and now &#x2013; owners who are always off on some epic-like quest over the sea
      to quarry stone from some far off land to show off one day in their
      atriums, or perhaps constructing some monumental structure that (they
      believe) will stave off their inevitable deaths. Through establishing
      this set of opposing structures &#x2013; the light, contained lyric farm of the
      poet and the massive, transgressive epic estates of the wealthy &#x2013; Horace
      is able to establish the spatio-temporal limits of his <em>Odes</em> in a way
      that seems &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; to his Roman readers, especially in how they
      align with good old Roman <em>mores</em> regarding the luxury (or lack thereof)
      in one&#x2019;s own house.<sup id="fnref:135"><a href="#fn:135" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Yet there is a problem with a simple dichotomy between Horace&#x2019;s own
      rural structure and those of the rich villa owners whom he criticizes:
      this binary opposition does not appear, at least initially, to leave any
      room at all for the famous architextural structure of the poet presented
      in the finale to his first collection of <em>Odes</em>. There Horace proclaims
      that the <em>monumentum</em> of his lyric poetry will soar &#x201C;loftier than the
      royal structure of the pyramids&#x201D; (<em>regali</em>&#x2026;<em>situ pyramidum altius</em>,
      <em>C</em>. 3.30.2); more than that, the structure will exist outside of the
      temporal boundaries that nature imposes on everything man-made through
      its &#x201C;decaying rain&#x201D; and the &#x201C;flight of ages&#x201D; (<em>imber edax</em>&#x2026;<em>fuga
      temporum</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.3-5). Horace even goes so far as to state that
      through his <em>monumentum</em> he &#x201C;will not die completely&#x201D; (<em>non omnis
      moriar</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.6). How could the same Horace who tells his reader to
      &#x201C;forget about the pointless honors of a tomb&#x201D; (<em>sepulcri</em> / <em>mitte
      supervacuos honores,</em> <em>C</em>. 2.20.23-24) at the end of the previous book
      suddenly turn around at the conclusion of Book 3 and claim to have
      erected a <em>monumentum</em> grander than even the pyramids? All this is
      suggestive of the mindset of those same villa owners whom he reprimands
      throughout the <em>Odes</em> for forgetting the enjoyment of the lyric &#x201C;here
      and now.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:136"><a href="#fn:136" class="footnote">17</a></sup> It would appear, then, that at the very edge of his
      lyric corpus Horace transgresses the boundaries established through his
      own small estate and ventures into building an architextural structure
      whose dimensions he formerly rejected as antithetical to his
      lyric.<sup id="fnref:137"><a href="#fn:137" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>I argue in this chapter that this transgressive <em>monumentum</em> is in fact
      the perfect symbol for Horace&#x2019;s architexture. The &#x201C;tension&#x201D; found in the
      <em>Odes</em> between the two opposed architextural styles of the farm and the
      transgressive villa is not a problem to be solved, but rather is an
      essential to the ultimate success of Horace&#x2019;s redefinition of
      &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric. This tension is not an accident, moreover, but the
      intended result of a rhetorical strategy that Horace uses repeatedly in
      the <em>Odes</em> to introduce extrageneric material from epic into his lyric
      without destabilizing its lyric foundations &#x2013; a rhetorical device that I
      call an &#x201C;inverted&#x201D; <em>recusatio</em> (&#x201C;refusal&#x201D;). The paradigmatic <em>recusatio</em>
      involves a poet who is told by some divine figure not to write
      epic.<sup id="fnref:138"><a href="#fn:138" class="footnote">19</a></sup> In Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em>, though, it is the poet <em>himself</em> who
      often feels he has to restrain his Muse who has wandered off into very
      non-lyric territory which the poet then describes at length. Through
      this device, I suggest, Horace is able to offset the innovations he is
      making to traditional lyric space and time through the inclusion of
      extrageneric material in such a way that his structure remains stable
      even as it is redefined &#x2013; a process that Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em>
      represents perfectly in its own seemingly paradoxical ability to be both
      stable and dynamic.</p>
      
      <p>This chapter will be divided into four parts. The first will briefly
      examine the Augustan <em>recusatio</em> with a view to the ways in which Horace
      inverts the typical formula of the trope in his <em>Odes</em>, as well as his
      potential reasons for doing so. The next part will deal with how Horace
      uses this trope to bring extrageneric space and time in tension with the
      lyric dimensions of his farm so as to revitalize while also altering the
      structure of &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric. The third part will turn to <em>C</em>. 3.30
      to suggest that these tensions within the poet&#x2019;s architexture are
      represented there, as well, in a monument which is both more stable than
      anything ever constructed and yet constantly changing. Finally, the
      fourth part will explore how Horace&#x2019;s redefinition of &#x201C;traditional&#x201D;
      lyric in his poetry mirrors strategies employed by Augustus himself in
      the <em>Res Gestae</em> to redefine the traditional structures of Rome, both
      literal and metaphorical.<sup id="fnref:139"><a href="#fn:139" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
      
      <h3 id="part-1-the-inversion-of-the-recusatio-in-horace">Part 1. The Inversion of the <em>Recusatio</em> in Horace</h3>
      
      <p>Although the <em>recusatio</em> was a common trope that many Augustan poets
      employed to &#x201C;extricate themselves from the expected imposition&#x201D; to write
      epics on the military exploits of Augustus,<sup id="fnref:140"><a href="#fn:140" class="footnote">21</a></sup> the rhetorical device
      takes its cue from the programmatic opening of Callimachus&#x2019; highly
      influential <em>Aitia</em>.<sup id="fnref:141"><a href="#fn:141" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In the prologue to that Hellenistic work the
      narrator claims that Apollo himself appeared to him as he was about to
      compose a poem. The god then told the poet that he should &#x201C;raise [his]
      sacrificial victim to be as fat as possible &#x2013; but nurture [his] Muse
      to be slender&#x201D; (&#x3C4;&#x1F78; &#x3BC;&#x1F72;&#x3BD; &#x3B8;&#x3CD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x1F45;&#x3C4;&#x3C4;&#x3B9; &#x3C0;&#x3AC;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; / &#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3AD;&#x3C8;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;, &#x3C4;&#x1F74;]&#x3BD; &#x39C;&#x3BF;&#x1FE6;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3BD; &#x3B4;&#x2019;
      &#x1F60;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x1F72; &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3AD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;, <em>Aitia</em> fr. 1.23-24). And it was this particular
      version of &#x201C;divine intervention&#x201D; that was then to establish the standard
      formula for the <em>recusatio</em> which the Augustan poets would take up over
      two centuries later at Rome: a divine being appears to the poet, forbids
      him from engaging in epic flight, and suggests instead that he should
      keep to light matters and meters.</p>
      
      <p>The earliest full Latin example we have of such a <em>recusatio</em> appears in
      Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Eclogues</em> where it is a humble shepherd &#x2013; as a stand-in for
      the poet himself &#x2013; who first sounds the strain of &#x201C;refusal&#x201D;:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
      uellit, et admonuit: &#x201C;Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
      pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen.&#x201D;
      nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
      Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
      agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam.
      non iniussa cano&#x2026; (Verg. <em>Ecl</em>. 6.3-9)</p>
      
        <p>When I was starting to sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my
      ear, and warned me: &#x201C;Tityrus, it is fitting for the shepherd to make
      his sheep fat, to utter a song finely spun.&#x201D; Now I (and for there will
      be others, Varus, who will wish to tell your praises and compose poems
      about gloomy wars) will practice the rustic Muse on a slender reed.
      The songs I sing are not unordered&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The standard formula that begins with Callimachus is illustrated
      perfectly here: the divine Apollo appears to the poet, tells him to
      forget about epic, and advises that he focus instead on singing a
      finely-spun song (cf. <em>oportet</em>&#x2026;<em>deductum dicere carmen</em>, 5). As the
      premier instance of the trope in surviving Latin poetry, it has been
      argued, this Vergilian <em>recusatio</em> helped to cement the Callimachean
      version as the prototype for Roman poets to follow.<sup id="fnref:142"><a href="#fn:142" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>In the poetry of Horace, however, there is something that seems off
      about his &#x201C;refusals,&#x201D; for they do not seem to be proper refusals at all.
      Steele Commager was right to assert that the Horatian <em>recusatio</em> is a
      bit peculiar. &#x201C;The <em>recusatio</em> was of course a common form,&#x201D; Commager
      begins, &#x201C;but in Horace&#x2019;s hands it usually becomes equivalent to the
      rhetorician&#x2019;s <em>praeteritio</em>.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote">24</a></sup> In the introductory poem to his
      Second Book of <em>Satires</em>, for example, Horace sets himself in dialogue
      with an interlocutor who advises him that he <em>should</em> write epic only to
      have Horace respond by declining the offer &#x2013; all the while giving a
      rather &#x201C;descriptive catalogue&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:144"><a href="#fn:144" class="footnote">25</a></sup> of those same epic themes that he
      is disavowing:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x201C;&#x2026;aut si tantus amor scribendi te rapit, aude
      Caesaris invicti res dicere, multa laborum
      praemia laturus.&#x201D; &#x201C;cupidum, pater optime, vires
      deficiunt; neque enim quivis horrentia pilis
      agmina nec fracta pereuntis cuspide Gallos
      aut labentis equo describit vulnera Parthi.&#x201D; (Hor. <em>Sat</em>.
      2.1.10-15)<sup id="fnref:145"><a href="#fn:145" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>&#x201C;Or if so great a love of writing snatches you, dare to utter the
      deeds of the unconquerable Caesar &#x2013; and you will carry off many
      rewards for your labors.&#x201D; &#x201C;Though I desire it, my good sir, my
      strength fails me; for not just anyone at all can describe the battle
      lines bristling with spears, nor the Gauls dying when the points of
      their spears have been broken, or the wounds of a Parthian falling
      from his horse.&#x201D;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This passage contains not only an &#x201C;inversion&#x201D; of the typical formula &#x2013;
      in that the one addressing the poet is actually <em>encouraging</em> him to
      write epic &#x2013; but also demonstrates how such an inverted <em>recusatio</em> can
      offer the poet a chance to &#x201C;commandeer his language from the subjects he
      rejects.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:146"><a href="#fn:146" class="footnote">27</a></sup> In other words, the poet employs a catalog of epic
      themes to give the reader the sense that he is more than adequate at
      doing the very thing he professes that he cannot.<sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em> extends this function of the trope even further. The
      poet inverts the procedure of the <em>recusatio</em> in a still more remarkable
      manner by at times reprimanding his own Muse for overstepping the
      boundaries of his lyric domain. In the introductory poem of <em>Odes</em> 2,
      for instance, Horace starts by discussing the gloomy nature of Pollio&#x2019;s
      works on the civil wars; he reproduces so much epic-sounding material,
      however, that the poet then feels compelled to &#x201C;reel in&#x201D; his own Muse
      before he can end the poem,<sup id="fnref:148"><a href="#fn:148" class="footnote">29</a></sup> as the passage below demonstrates:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Sed ne relictis, Musa procax, iocis
      Ceae retractes munera neniae,
      mecum Dionaeo sub antro
      quaere modos leuiore plectro. (Hor. <em>C</em>. 2.1.37-40)</p>
      
        <p>But lest you, my naughty Muse, take up again the rites of the Cean
      dirge leaving behind all jokes, seek measures on a lighter instrument
      with me within the cavern of Venus.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In this passage it is Horace himself &#x2013; and not some divine being &#x2013; who
      instructs <em>his</em> Muse to behave herself and stick to light topics that
      are more fitting for light meters. This is not the last glimpse we get
      of Horace&#x2019;s <em>procax</em> Muse, though. In Book 3 the poet again feels his
      Muse has begun to slip out of his control after he has sung about a
      council of the gods in which Juno delivers a lengthy (and epic-sounding)
      prophecy for Rome. Here is the poet&#x2019;s address to his Muse at the poem&#x2019;s
      conclusion:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae:
      quo, Musa, tendis? desine pervicax
      referre sermones deorum et
      magna modis tenuare parvis. (<em>C</em>. 3.3.69-72)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>This will not be fitting for my playful lyre: where are you heading,
      my Muse? Intractable! Cease to report the speeches of gods and to
      diminish great things with your small measures.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In both of these passages it is not the usual divine being that comes to
      Horace to turn him away from the epic mode; it is rather the poet
      himself who confronts his Muse &#x2013; not for inspiration, as one might
      expect, but to restrain her from going into generic territory (cf.
      <em>Ceae&#x2026;neniae</em>; <em>magna</em>) which is unfitting for his light lyric poetry
      (cf. <em>leviore plectro</em>; <em>iocosae&#x2026;lyrae</em>; <em>modis&#x2026; parvis</em>).<sup id="fnref:149"><a href="#fn:149" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It should be clear by now what I mean by &#x201C;inverted&#x201D; <em>recusatio</em> when
      comparing the Horatian art of &#x201C;refusal&#x201D; to the typical formula employed
      by other poets. But why does Horace invert the trope in the first place?
      What does the poet gain by transfiguring the <em>recusatio</em> formula in such
      a way? Commager recognized the tension that such &#x201C;refusals&#x201D; produce, but
      never fully resolved it. &#x201C;Horace stands as the classic example,&#x201D; he
      writes,</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>of the man who manages to eat his cake and have it too. Indulging the
      most extravagant of pastoral fantasies, he escapes charges of
      sentimentality; dispensing moral unction, he avoids the reproach of
      sermonizing; rising to an epic grandeur, he denies pretensions to
      sublimity; summoning all wealth&#x2019;s sensuous reality, he receives credit
      for banishing it.<sup id="fnref:150"><a href="#fn:150" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>And the scholar ends his discussion of the tension there. Peter Smith
      also left the matter of this &#x201C;tension&#x201D; only &#x201C;partially solved&#x201D; by his
      own admittance.<sup id="fnref:151"><a href="#fn:151" class="footnote">32</a></sup> For Smith the tension is one that
      (unsatisfactorily even to him) seems to be located within the historical
      person of the poet himself: &#x201C;in the <em>recusatio</em>, the slender poet had
      shown an irresistible tendency to soar, for all his reticence. [&#x2026;]
      Though he had learned to live with the conflicting drives of self and
      state, Horace was never altogether comfortable.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:152"><a href="#fn:152" class="footnote">33</a></sup> The main issue I
      take with these approaches (besides the obvious biographical fallacy
      which motivates Smith&#x2019;s reading) is that they consider this &#x201C;tension&#x201D; to
      be a problem which needs to be solved rather than a crucial component of
      how Horace constructs his particular lyric structure, as I will suggest
      below.</p>
      
      <p>Gregson Davis, Mich&#xE8;le Lowrie, and Stephen Harrison have each attempted
      in more recetn decades to provide a more nuanced approach to this same
      tension through their respective studies on the rhetorical posturing of
      Horatian lyric.<sup id="fnref:153"><a href="#fn:153" class="footnote">34</a></sup> Their answers focus on how Horace uses these
      moments to introduce extrageneric material into his lyric poetry &#x2013;
      whether through what they term generic &#x201C;assimilation,&#x201D; &#x201C;negation,&#x201D; or
      &#x201C;enrichment,&#x201D; respectively. Davis suggests that &#x201C;the supposed aim of
      &#x2018;refusal&#x2019; probably masks an intent to <em>incorporate</em>, rather than utterly
      repudiate, matter traditionally regarded as alien to a particular
      literary orientation,&#x201D; with the result that Horace can then &#x201C;assimilate&#x201D;
      other genres through disavowing their material.<sup id="fnref:154"><a href="#fn:154" class="footnote">35</a></sup> The idea of
      &#x201C;generic enrichment&#x201D; that Harrison has put forth more recently does not
      differ much from Davis&#x2019; understanding of these disavowels: &#x201C;generic
      enrichment,&#x201D; as Harrison defines it, is &#x201C;the way in which generically
      identifiable texts gain literary depth and texture from detailed
      confrontation with, and consequent inclusion of elements from, texts
      which appear to belong to other literary genres.&#x201D; <sup id="fnref:155"><a href="#fn:155" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Neither of
      these scholars looks outside of Horace&#x2019;s lyric world for the motivation
      behind these rhetorical gestures.<sup id="fnref:156"><a href="#fn:156" class="footnote">37</a></sup> In contrast to these studies
      Lowrie&#x2019;s reading of Horace&#x2019;s &#x201C;disavowals&#x201D; does extend beyond the poetic
      implications and into the political realities of the Augustan age.
      Although she also claims that Horace&#x2019;s &#x201C;poetry defines itself largely by
      saying what it is not,&#x201D; Lowrie convincingly argues that this
      &#x201C;tug-of-war&#x2026;surpasses the formal conflict within the aesthetic realm, to
      encompass that between aesthetics and ideology.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:157"><a href="#fn:157" class="footnote">38</a></sup> While Lowrie&#x2019;s
      approach does then help to show how Horace&#x2019;s project of lyric definition
      interacts with elements of Augustan ideology, it does not go deeper to
      explore fully how the poet is also engaging with the very ways in which
      that ideology was itself promoted<sup id="fnref:158"><a href="#fn:158" class="footnote">39</a></sup> &#x2013; as it was through Augustus&#x2019;
      own <em>Res Gestae</em>, for instance, in the ways I will suggest in Part 4
      below.</p>
      
      <p>I would like to acknowledge at the outset that scholars have touched
      obliquely upon a possible connection between the respective rhetorical
      stances of the poet and the <em>princeps</em>.<sup id="fnref:159"><a href="#fn:159" class="footnote">40</a></sup> Karl Galinsky&#x2019;s reading of
      the repeated use of <em>recusatio</em> in the <em>Odes</em> probably comes closest to
      some of the conclusions I arrive at in this chapter in that he also sees
      the kind of rhetorical &#x201C;refusals&#x201D; that Augustus makes in the <em>Res
      Gestae</em> as a source of indirect &#x201C;inspiration&#x201D; for the poet.<sup id="fnref:160"><a href="#fn:160" class="footnote">41</a></sup> The
      scholar spends only a paragraph on this idea, however, and does not
      fully develop the parallel. Nor does he look at what either Augustus or
      Horace has to say about architecture in this context &#x2013; which will be the
      main focus of my comparison between the two at the end of this chapter.</p>
      
      <p>Before I can discuss the nuances of this parallel, however, it will
      first be necessary to work through the complex nature of Horace&#x2019;s own
      architexture in the <em>Odes</em>. The next two sections of this chapter builds
      on the scholarship discussed above to ask not just <em>how</em> Horace defines
      traditional lyric space and time, but also <em>why</em> he does it in the
      precise way he does, that is, through a delicate balancing of the two
      opposed architextural images of his farm and the transgressive Roman
      villas he criticizes. It is by recognizing the importance of this
      tension, I suggest, that one can better understand how Horace&#x2019;s
      <em>monumentum</em> in <em>C</em>. 3.30 is a perfect metaphor not only for his own
      poems, but just as much for the age of redefinition in which he
      constructs it &#x2013; an age when the seemingly paradoxical idea that one
      could redefine what was &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; became an important way for the
      <em>princeps</em> to articulate what it meant to be Roman.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-2-transgressive-architexture-in-the-odes">Part 2. Transgressive Architexture in the <em>Odes</em></h3>
      
      <p>The latter half of Horace&#x2019;s second book of <em>Odes</em> and the beginning of
      the third contain several poems that discuss excessive architectural
      structures. The focus of this section will be on the most extensive of
      such discussions, namely, <em>C</em>. 2.18 and 3.1. Although Horace in these
      poems might seem to portray grand, ostentatious architecture in an
      unappealing light in contrast to his modest Sabine farm, it is by
      claiming to disavow such transgressive structures that the poet is
      actually able to make them a part of his traditional lyric space and
      time. Let us start with the beginning of <em>C</em>. 2.18:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Non ebur neque aureum
      mea renidet in domo lacunar,
      non trabes Hymettiae
      premunt columnas ultima recisas
      Africa, neque Attali 5
      ignotus heres regiam occupavi
      [&#x2026;]
      &#x2026;nihil supra
      deos lacesso nec potentem amicum
      largiora flagito,
      satis beatus unicis Sabinis. (<em>C</em>. 2.18.1-6, 11-14)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>An ivory and golden ceiling does not shine in my house, Hymettian
      beams do not press upon columns quarried from the ends of Africa, nor
      have I as the unknowing heir to an Attalus come in the possession of a
      palace [&#x2026;] I bother the gods for nothing more, nor do I demand
      anything more lavish from my powerful friend, content enough as I am
      with my unique Sabine holdings.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This opening priamel should come as no surprise for readers of Horace:
      not only is it an &#x201C;imitation&#x201D; of Bacchylides fr. 21;<sup id="fnref:161"><a href="#fn:161" class="footnote">42</a></sup> the theme of
      excessively luxurious architecture should be rather familiar by the time
      one reaches this poem near the end of Book 2.<sup id="fnref:162"><a href="#fn:162" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Horace has devoted
      many lines already to criticizing such structures and the problems that
      accompany them. In <em>Odes</em> 2.10, for instance, he warns against &#x201C;halls
      inciting envy&#x201D; (<em>invidenda&#x2026;aula</em>, 7-8). <em>C</em>. 2.15 begins with a lament
      that &#x201C;regal structures soon will leave a few acres for the plough&#x201D; (<em>iam
      pauca aratro iugera regiae</em> / <em>moles relinquent</em>, 1-2) &#x2013; quite in
      contrast to the traditional Roman way of life that the poet discusses in
      the latter half of that poem (cf. <em>C.</em> 2.15.10-20). As Horace then notes
      in <em>C</em>. 2.16, such structures only serve to make one more anxious with
      all &#x201C;the cares that flitter about paneled ceilings&#x201D; (<em>curas laqueata
      circum</em> / <em>tecta volantis</em>, 11-12). It should not be unexpected
      therefore to find Horace ranting against such architecture at the
      beginning of <em>C</em>. 2.18, as he relates all those trappings of luxury
      which are <em>not</em> in his own house, including a ceiling of ivory and gold
      (<em>ebur&#x2026;aureum</em>&#x2026;<em>lacunar</em>, 1-2), marble beams (<em>trabes Hymettias</em>, 3),
      and columns quarried from the ends of Africa (<em>columnas ultima recisas</em>
      / <em>Africa</em>, 4-5).</p>
      
      <p>It is not just the luxury itself that is the problem, however, as much
      as the excessive and <em>transgressive</em> nature of building such a &#x201C;palace&#x201D;
      (<em>regiam</em>, <em>C.</em> 2.18.6).<sup id="fnref:163"><a href="#fn:163" class="footnote">44</a></sup> Taking marble from a distant locale is
      not the only way that these villa owners seek to extend their boundaries
      across and beyond natural boundaries.<sup id="fnref:164"><a href="#fn:164" class="footnote">45</a></sup> The poet goes on to accuse
      the rich of &#x201C;greedily tear[ing] down the boundary stones of [their]
      land and leap[ing] beyond the borders of [their] clients&#x201D; (<em>revellis
      agri terminos et ultra</em> / <em>limites clientium</em> / <em>salis avarus</em>, <em>C</em>.
      2.18.24-26); even worse, these avaricious individuals desire to extend
      their villas so as &#x201C;to drive back the shores of the sea, being too
      little rich themselves since the shore restrains them&#x201D;
      (<em>maris</em>&#x2026;<em>summovere</em> <em>litora</em>, / <em>parum locuples continente ripa</em>,
      <em>C</em>. 2.18.20-22, cf. <em>C</em>. 3.1.34-38). Both of these actions are examples
      of what Ellen Oliensis has called a &#x201C;debauched imperialism&#x201D; in which
      &#x201C;formal, spatial, and moral boundaries all give way at once&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:165"><a href="#fn:165" class="footnote">46</a></sup> &#x2013; not
      to mention natural and social ones.<sup id="fnref:166"><a href="#fn:166" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>What scholars have paid less attention to here are the generic
      boundaries being crossed with the specific and marked image of extending
      one&#x2019;s villa into the sea &#x2013; a space in the <em>Odes</em> which has often been
      read as &#x201C;a recurrent image for unsettledness and danger.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:167"><a href="#fn:167" class="footnote">48</a></sup> The
      various reasons to sail on the sea &#x2013; for trade, for making money, for
      expanding one&#x2019;s power &#x2013; all present values that oppose the quiet life of
      <em>autarkeia</em> that Horace imagines for himself in several poems of the
      collection,<sup id="fnref:168"><a href="#fn:168" class="footnote">49</a></sup> including the very first one with its famous opening
      priamel (cf. <em>C.</em> 1.1.11-14). As the reader learns only shortly later in
      <em>C</em>. 1.3, moreover, the very act of sailing is a &#x201C;crime&#x201D; (<em>nefas</em>, 26)
      against the natural order of things: &#x201C;The prudent god divided the lands
      from the discordant Ocean in vain, if impious ships still sail over
      waters that are not to be touched&#x201D; (<em>nequiquam deus abscidit</em> / <em>prudens
      Oceano dissociabili</em> / <em>terras, si tamen impiae</em> / <em>non tangenda rates
      transiliunt vada</em>, 21-24). Horace even goes so far in that poem as to
      associate sailing with other famous acts that defy the natural
      limitations of man, including Promethean thefts, Herculean journeys to
      the underworld, and precarious Daedalean flights (cf. <em>C.</em>
      1.3.27-36).<sup id="fnref:169"><a href="#fn:169" class="footnote">50</a></sup> From almost the very start, then, the sea in the
      <em>Odes</em> comes to represent a space beyond the limits imposed on all
      mortals.</p>
      
      <p>But the borders that Horace is working out in <em>C</em>. 1.3 are not just
      related to natural limitations of man; rather, as the famous addressee
      of the poem would suggest, these bounds of nature are also meant to
      represent the generic boundaries that are being crossed in that poem, as
      well as in several others of the collection.<sup id="fnref:170"><a href="#fn:170" class="footnote">51</a></sup> The poet in <em>C</em> 1.3
      is wishing his good friend Vergil a safe journey to Athens. That is what
      the poem claims on its surface, at least. It is hard, however, not to
      understant this <em>bon voyage</em> as having more to do with Vergil&#x2019;s work on
      the epic <em>Aeneid</em> than a simple trans-Adriatic crossing.<sup id="fnref:171"><a href="#fn:171" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Indeed,
      as Michael Paschalis has put it, the &#x201C;open sea space&#x201D; in the <em>Odes</em>
      functions as &#x201C;a metaphor or metonym&#x2026;for non-lyric (&#x2018;grander&#x2019;) genres
      and themes,&#x201D; such as epic poetry.<sup id="fnref:172"><a href="#fn:172" class="footnote">53</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The generic implications of this trope likewise appear in several other
      poems in the first and second books of the <em>Odes</em>. In the famous Soracte
      Ode, for example, Horace advises his companion to &#x201C;entrust everything
      else to the gods who have now calmed the warring winds on the seething
      surface of the sea&#x201D; (<em>permitte divis cetera, qui simul / stravere ventos
      aequore fervido / deproeliantis</em>, <em>C</em>. 1.9.9-11) &#x2013; the stormy sea having
      no place within the intimate lyric atmosphere of Horace&#x2019;s private
      space.<sup id="fnref:173"><a href="#fn:173" class="footnote">54</a></sup> This idea is then made even more explicit in <em>C</em>. 1.14,
      where the fragile ship which Horace addresses has rightly been read as a
      representation of his poetry: it is a craft whose parts &#x201C;creak&#x201D;
      (<em>gemant</em>, <em>C</em>. 1.14.6) and lines are shred (cf. <em>non tibi sunt integra
      lineta</em>, 9), certainly no match for the harsh waters and &#x201C;winds&#x201D;
      (<em>ventis</em>, 15) of epic.<sup id="fnref:174"><a href="#fn:174" class="footnote">55</a></sup> One can similarly interpret <em>C</em>. 1.34 and
      the poet&#x2019;s aborted sea journey into &#x201C;epic&#x201D; territory in that poem.<sup id="fnref:175"><a href="#fn:175" class="footnote">56</a></sup>
      In Book 2 itself, moreover, traditional lyric space is repeatedly carved
      out in contrast to those who wish to seek out the deep even when there
      are storms on the water (<em>C</em>. 2.10.1-3), or those who find themselves
      trapped in the wide open sea when rough weather has suddenly befallen
      them (<em>C.</em> 2.16.1-4).<sup id="fnref:176"><a href="#fn:176" class="footnote">57</a></sup> By the time a reader gets to <em>C</em>. 2.18,
      then, the act of entering the open sea is not only an established trope
      for crossing boundaries; it is a generically charged action, as well,
      when read in juxtaposition with several poems in Books 1 and 2 of the
      <em>Odes</em>.</p>
      
      <p>What then should a reader make of those who build villas that transgress
      the maritime boundaries of the natural world &#x2013; who literally &#x201C;drive back
      the shores of the sea&#x201D; (<em>maris&#x2026;</em> / <em>summovere litora</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.18.20-21)
      through their constructions? Such builders are clearly engaging in an
      ambitious undertaking that would seem rather out of tune with the
      traditional lyric space that Horace delineates for himself, that is, a
      space which seems completely opposed to the extension of boundaries,
      whether physical, natural, or generic, as I will suggest below in the
      figure of his Sabine farm. Bad as all this is, though, such architecture
      in <em>Odes</em> 2.18 not only transgresses the spatial bounds of &#x201C;traditional&#x201D;
      lyric, but the temporal ones, as well:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>tu secanda marmora
      locas sub ipsum funus et sepulcri
      immemor struis domos</p>
      
        <p>[&#x2026;]</p>
      
        <p>Nulla certior tamen
      rapacis Orci fine destinata
      aula divitem manet
      erum. Quid ultra tendis? (<em>C</em>. 2.18.17-19, 29-32)</p>
      
        <p>At the very footstep of death you contract marble to be cut and
      unmindful of the tomb pile up houses. [&#x2026;] Nevertheless, when the
      territory of rapacious Death has been reached, no palace more surely
      awaits the rich master. Why do you strive further?</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>While the rich go beyond the physical limits prescribed by man and
      nature in extending their homes across boundary stones and even into the
      sea, respectively, there is also the suggestion here that in doing so
      they no longer have any concern for death (cf. <em>sub ipsum funus
      sepulcri</em> / <em>immemor struis domos</em>, 18-19), especially in their apparent
      belief that what they build will protect them from its
      inevitability.<sup id="fnref:177"><a href="#fn:177" class="footnote">58</a></sup> According to Ellen Oliensis, in fact, the rich man
      in this passage is actually &#x201C;seek[ing] to postpone the temporal
      <em>finis</em> of death by expanding the <em>fines</em> of his property.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:178"><a href="#fn:178" class="footnote">59</a></sup> Yet it
      does not matter what kind of building you erect for yourself; when you
      are dead, the poet warns, &#x201C;no palace more surely awaits the rich master&#x201D;
      (<em>nulla certior&#x2026;</em> / <em>aula divitem manet</em> / <em>erum</em>, 29, 31-32).<sup id="fnref:179"><a href="#fn:179" class="footnote">60</a></sup> The
      greedy aristocrat has lost sight of the lyric &#x201C;here and now&#x201D; in his
      desire to extend his building activities further past all boundaries,
      temporal as well as spatial, and seek the sort of immortality more
      befitting an epic hero who will be kept alive in song. It seems that it
      is all for naught, though. All Horace can do is to ask such misguided
      men a version of a question that he asks in reprimanding his naughty
      Muse, namely, &#x201C;why do you stive further&#x201D; (<em>quid ultra tendis</em>,
      32).<sup id="fnref:180"><a href="#fn:180" class="footnote">61</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>In contrast to this excessive, seemingly unlimited drive of such
      architecture to transgress boundaries, both spatial and temporal, stands
      Horace&#x2019;s own &#x201C;unique Sabine holdings&#x201D; (<em>unicis Sabinis</em>, <em>C</em>. 2.18.14).
      There is not much to say about Horace&#x2019;s country abode, however, since
      the structure (rather conspicuously) bears no architectural description
      for a poem largely devoted to detailed accounts of architecture.<sup id="fnref:181"><a href="#fn:181" class="footnote">62</a></sup>
      It is almost as though the Sabine farm has left no imprint on nature at
      all. And that might be part of the point: Horace&#x2019;s farm blends into the
      landscape, not extending further than it should, not overstepping the
      bounds of nature.<sup id="fnref:182"><a href="#fn:182" class="footnote">63</a></sup> The humble structure serves, according to Paul
      Allen Miller, as &#x201C;the symbol of his acceptance of the limits of
      mortality on normal human existence,&#x201D; as well as &#x201C;a symbol of Horace&#x2019;s
      poetry, of his satisfaction with his lot in life.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:183"><a href="#fn:183" class="footnote">64</a></sup> It is very
      different, in other words, from the transgressive structures that fill
      the rest of the poem and several of those in Book 2 &#x2013; structures whose
      owners unlike Horace are never &#x201C;happy enough&#x201D; (<em>satis beatus</em>, <em>C</em>.
      2.18.14) with what they already have at the present moment.</p>
      
      <p>It might seem, then, that for Horace architecture which seeks to go
      beyond the boundaries of lyric space and time achieves nothing in the
      end &#x2013; and certainly does not adhere to his traditional lyric principles
      of design.<sup id="fnref:184"><a href="#fn:184" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Such architecture is not just ostentatious; more
      importantly, it is <em>transgressive</em>, spatially as well as temporally. And
      the first poem of Book 3 elaborates further on this idea:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;somnus agrestium
      lenis virorum non humilis domos
      fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
      non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
      desiderantem quod satis est neque
      tumultuosum sollicitat mare</p>
      
        <p>[&#x2026;]</p>
      
        <p>quodsi dolentem nec Phrygius lapis
      nec purpuratum sidere clarior
      delenit usus nec Falerna
      vitis Achaemeniumque costum,
      cur invidendis postibus et novo
      sublime ritu moliar atrium?
      cur valle permutem Sabina
      divitias operosiores (<em>C</em>. 3.1.21-26, 41-48)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Gentle sleep does not despise the humble houses of rustic men and the
      shady riverbank, nor is the valley of Tempe disturbed by storm winds.
      The tumultuous sea does not bother the man desiring what is enough.
      [&#x2026;] But if Phrygian stone does not soothe a grieving man, nor
      wearing purple more brilliant than a star, nor Falernian wine or
      Persian perfume, why should I construct a lofty atrium in a new style,
      with doorposts that incite envy? Why should I exchange my Sabine
      valley for riches more full of worries?</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The imagery here should be familiar by now to a reader of the <em>Odes</em>
      after all the warnings against the dangerous sea and luxurious
      architecture in the first two books. The tumultuous sea (<em>tumultuosum&#x2026;
      mare</em>, 26) is of no concern to simple, &#x201C;rustic&#x201D; (<em>agrestium</em>, 21) men
      like Horace who inhabit &#x201C;humble homes&#x201D; (<em>humilis domos</em>, 22), only
      &#x201C;desiring what is enough&#x201D; (<em>desiderantem quod satis est</em>, 25).<sup id="fnref:185"><a href="#fn:185" class="footnote">66</a></sup>
      After all, a grieving man cannot be helped by what such exploration can
      bring back, whether it be wealth, or the marble columns, purple dye,
      wine, and perfume that accompany it (41-45). What is the point, the poet
      therefore asks, of building a grand structure in a new style
      (<em>novo&#x2026;ritu</em>, 45-46) &#x2013; one that is designed with doorposts that will
      just incite envy (<em>invidendis postibus</em>, 45) and a lofty hall
      (<em>sublime&#x2026;atrium</em>, 46) whose very height could only serve to cause one
      concern?<sup id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186" class="footnote">67</a></sup> In contrast to all this &#x201C;modern&#x201D; architecture once again
      stands Horace&#x2019;s own lowly farm, or rather &#x2013; in a way that calls even
      less attention to its actual physical structure &#x2013; his &#x201C;Sabine valley&#x201D;
      (<em>valle&#x2026;Sabina</em>, <em>C.</em> 3.1.47).<sup id="fnref:187"><a href="#fn:187" class="footnote">68</a></sup> According to the poet, at least,
      that is all he needs to be content.</p>
      
      <p>Is he actually content, though? Horace spends quite a bit of time, as we
      have seen, describing the excessiveness of villa architecture in the
      <em>Odes</em> &#x2013; so much time, in fact, that Eleanor Leach has seen some of
      these poems as &#x201C;virtually a celebration of luxury.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:188"><a href="#fn:188" class="footnote">69</a></sup> If Horace has
      such great contempt for these structures, why then does he devote so
      many poems and lines to describing them and relatively so little to the
      description of his own modest farm? I will return to that question
      momentarily. It is important, though, to understand that &#x2013; as with the
      architectural rants in Book 2 &#x2013; personal luxury here is not the only, or
      even most important, referent.<sup id="fnref:189"><a href="#fn:189" class="footnote">70</a></sup> There is a sense that the excessive
      villa and the humble farm combine to form a kind of generic discourse;
      they are architextural, in other words, to use the terminology put
      forward in this dissertation.<sup id="fnref:190"><a href="#fn:190" class="footnote">71</a></sup> Nor has the metapoetic nature of
      these structures escaped scholars of the <em>Odes</em>. Riemer Faber has
      correctly suggested, for instance, that &#x201C;[j]ust as the Sabine estate
      represents a lifestyle and literary aesthetic that contrasts with
      greater wealth associated with a more ambitious form of poetry, so too
      the preceding clause, in 3.1.45-46, may be read as literary
      discourse.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:191"><a href="#fn:191" class="footnote">72</a></sup> According to Faber&#x2019;s argument, <em>C.</em> 3.1 in particular
      is about the pressures of joining &#x201C;private, non-political life and
      personal poetry to public, national, and political poetry.&#x201D; It is not
      that Horace is unable to do so, Faber claims, but rather that he is
      &#x201C;express[ing] the difficulty he has in uniting them.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:192"><a href="#fn:192" class="footnote">73</a></sup> Horace
      cannot escape the public spotlight, the argument runs, and its trappings
      of wealth and grandeur cannot but find their way into his private lyric.</p>
      
      <p>Even if one were to forgive the biographical fallacy to which this view
      runs dangerously close, Faber&#x2019;s conclusion nevertheless does not seem to
      give Horace enough credit, especially if one considers more closely the
      nuanced rhetorical stance that the poet is taking in these odes on
      architecture. The constant attention to transgressive architecture does
      not necessarily mean that Horace is having &#x201C;difficulty&#x201D; fitting it
      together with his traditional lyric mode as represented by his modest
      farm. The previous section introduced the idea of the inverted
      <em>recusatio</em> in the <em>Odes</em> for poems in which Horace reprimands his Muse
      for transgressing the limits of his lyric. This allowed the poet, I
      argued, to integrate extrageneric material from epic into his poem while
      actively disavowing it. A similar interpretation can be applied to his
      architextural images of excess and their owners in the poems examined in
      this section: it is not that the poet has trouble incorporating the
      grand, public, political mode into his humble, private, personal lyric;
      rather, on the contrary, he is able to do just that <em>through</em> claiming
      to renounce the former.</p>
      
      <p>For this technique to be effective, however, it requires a delicate
      balancing of the two sides. It is no wonder, then, that Horace spends so
      many lines on villas that try to extend beyond boundaries of traditional
      lyric space and time, of the lyric &#x201C;here and now,&#x201D; in contrast to so few
      on his own farm. Horace can easily establish his &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric
      space and time through the mere mention of his Sabine farm; the space
      automatically has the poet&#x2019;s stamp of approval because it is Horace&#x2019;s,
      after all, and Horace is a lyric poet. The Sabine farm does not need
      much therefore to authorize it as a symbolic architextural structure for
      Horace&#x2019;s lyric. To introduce the opposing extrageneric material is a
      different matter: the poet needs to give more attention to that which he
      claims to disavow &#x2013; as is common in the &#x201C;inverted&#x201D; <em>recusatio</em> trope &#x2013;
      so that it too can be become established in his poetry, even while
      Horace appears to reject it as another&#x2019;s prerogative. Too much
      description of his farm would throw this tension out of balance. Too
      little about the transgressive villas, on the other hand, and the reader
      might miss the point &#x2013; just as too much discussion of them would make
      Horace seem insincere in his rejection of them. The balance has to be
      just right, in other words, for the tensions to be weighed appropriately
      so that the boundary of &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric space and time that
      separates the two can remain stable.</p>
      
      <p>Mich&#xE8;le Lowrie interprets Horace&#x2019;s apparent &#x201C;crossing [of] the limits
      he has established&#x201D; as &#x201C;serv[ing] a definitional purpose&#x201D; for his
      poetics. While that interpretation is not incorrect, I do not agree with
      Lowrie&#x2019;s conclusion that the poet is &#x201C;mov[ing] from an initial
      limiting gesture, to an expansive one, back to a compromise between the
      two.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:193"><a href="#fn:193" class="footnote">74</a></sup> Horace is not entirely disingenuous in his injunctions
      against such transgressive structures. The function of the inverted
      <em>recusatio</em> is to make it possible, I would argue, for Horace to avoid
      choosing either the lyric farm or the &#x201C;epic&#x201D; architecture of
      contemporary villas &#x2013; or even to have to make a &#x201C;compromise&#x201D; between the
      two, as Lowrie suggests it. That does not mean Horace is employing the
      inverted <em>recusatio</em> trope here because he is non-committal, or because
      he wants to &#x201C;eat his cake and have it too,&#x201D; as Commager remarked.<sup id="fnref:194"><a href="#fn:194" class="footnote">75</a></sup>
      Maintaining this tension is in fact essential to Horace&#x2019;s redefinition
      of traditional lyric space and time: it serves to <em>reinforce</em> the
      stability of traditional lyric boundaries, even as they are redefined,
      in such a way that Horace can revitalize the structure without
      destabilizing its foundations.</p>
      
      <p>To undertand this complicated dynamic it might be helpful to turn to the
      theories of the 20^th^-century Russian semiotician Juri Lotman. In his
      <em>The Structure of the Artistic Text</em>, for example, Lotman argues that
      the &#x201C;violation&#x201D; of a structure can often catalyze the &#x201C;informational
      activization&#x201D; of that very same structure. In the case of an &#x201C;artistic
      text,&#x201D; in fact, the text</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>does not merely represent the implementation of structural norms, but
      their violation as well. It functions in a dual structural field
      consisting of the tendency to establish order and to violate it.
      Although each tendency tries to dominate and destroy the opposing one,
      the victory of either would prove fatal to art. <em>The life of an
      artistic text depends on their mutual tension</em>.<sup id="fnref:195"><a href="#fn:195" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The inclusion of extrageneric time and space through an inverted
      <em>recusatio</em> does not destabilize the generic boundaries of &#x201C;traditional&#x201D;
      lyric that are established through Horace&#x2019;s Sabine farm; rather, as
      Lotman suggests, the tension created helps to activate, or revitalize,
      the traditional structure of Horatian lyric &#x2013; and, more importantly, to
      keep it &#x201C;alive&#x201D; and dynamic. The poet&#x2019;s statements about his farm gain
      meaning and definition, in other words, from the contrast between it and
      the transgressive nature of the other architextural images in the
      <em>Odes</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>. The tension that is thus produced by the
      rhetorical figure of the inverted <em>recusatio</em> is not deleterious to the
      traditional boundaries of lyric but instead allows both sides of the
      spectrum to exist within Horace&#x2019;s lyric structure &#x2013; in tension, yes, but
      equally balanced in such a way as to keep the boundary between the two
      sides stable.</p>
      
      <p>The tension discussed in this section between the two architextural
      extremes is therefore integral to <em>stabilizing</em> the structure of
      &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric even while adding what might seem to be hostile to
      it. This notion of balanced tensions leading to stability and new life
      can also help account for the tensions that exist in Horace&#x2019;s most
      famous architextural image: his <em>monumentum</em> that concludes his first
      collection of <em>Odes</em>. It is in fact the tension within his poetry as
      brought out by the contrast between Horace&#x2019;s farm and transgressive
      architecture analyzed in this section that enables Horace to create a
      structure that is stable enough to overcome death and yet dynamic enough
      to always be &#x201C;fresh&#x201D; (<em>recens</em>, <em>C</em>. 3.30.8).</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-3-exegi-monumentum">Part 3. *Exegi Monumentum&#x2026;</h3>
      
      <p>In <em>C</em>. 2.10, the very ode in which Horace famously introduces the idea
      of the &#x201C;golden mean&#x201D; (<em>aurea mediocritas</em>, 5), the poet claims that
      &#x201C;high towers fall with a greater crash&#x201D; (<em>celsae graviore casu</em> /
      <em>decidunt turres</em>, 10-11). By so far as architecture departs from the
      natural bounds of space and time, the poet seems to be saying, to that
      degree it will tumble into ruin. Where does that leave Horace&#x2019;s own
      rather impressive monument that he imagines in <em>C</em>. 3.30? How does
      <em>that</em> fit into this picture when it seems to contradict so blatantly
      the kind of traditional lyric space and time symbolized by Horace&#x2019;s farm
      when contrasted to the transgressive villas discussed in the previous
      section?<sup id="fnref:196"><a href="#fn:196" class="footnote">77</a></sup> Indeed, Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> seems to transgress the
      very boundaries of his traditional lyric structure in an even more
      extreme manner than any structure which he criticizes previously in the
      <em>Odes</em>, as the beginning of the poem demonstrates:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Exegi monumentum aere perennius
      regalique situ pyramidum altius,
      quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens
      possit diruere aut innumerabilis
      annorum series et fuga temporum.
      non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei
      vitabit Libitinam: usque ego postera
      crescam laude recens&#x2026; (<em>C</em>. 3.30.1-8)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>I have completed a monument more lasting than bronze and loftier than
      the royal structure of the pyramids, which neither the decaying rain
      nor the powerless north wind could up-root &#x2013; or even the innumerable
      series of years and flight of ages. I will not die entirely, and a
      great part of me will avoid death: constantly I fresh will grow by
      posterity&#x2019;s praise&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This poem has been interpreted in a number of ways to account for the
      apparent contradiction between such a monument that completely
      transgresses the laws of nature and the earlier injunctions against the
      kind of architecture in Books 2 and 3 that does just that. Neville
      Collinge tries to solve the tension by considering that the poem is
      simply &#x201C;diffident in tone&#x201D; and not entirely serious.<sup id="fnref:197"><a href="#fn:197" class="footnote">78</a></sup> Don Fowler
      suggests, on the other hand, that the lack of &#x201C;restraint&#x201D; in the finale
      to the <em>Odes</em> is representative of a hidden &#x201C;guilty will to power&#x201D; on
      the part of Horace &#x2013; that the poet simply could not help but make such
      grand claims living in the regime that he does.<sup id="fnref:198"><a href="#fn:198" class="footnote">79</a></sup> Matthew Santirocco
      represents perhaps a middle position between these two approaches,
      arguing that while the poem might be &#x201C;a bit self-deprecatory&#x201D; the
      &#x201C;pride&#x201D; which Horace feels is genuine; in fact, according to Santirocco,
      the poem reveals a desire on the part of the poet to establish himself
      in such a way that he would become &#x201C;to poetry what Augustus is to the
      state.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:199"><a href="#fn:199" class="footnote">80</a></sup></p>

      <p><strong>Augustan monument (La Turbie, France)</strong></p>
      
      <p><br/></p>
      
      <p>I will explore the implications of this parallel between Augustus and
      Horace in the final section of this chapter. It is first necessary,
      though, to show how the architextural <em>monumentum</em> here is perhaps the
      perfect symbol for the kind of lyric that the poet has constructed in
      his <em>Odes</em>. Although it is transgressive to the highest degree, the
      <em>monumentum</em> is built just like the traditional lyric structure that
      Horace constructs, that is, through a balancing of tensions in such a
      way that the monument too can be more stable than anything ever built
      and yet eternally dynamic at the same time.<sup id="fnref:200"><a href="#fn:200" class="footnote">81</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The first five lines of the poem present the <em>monumentum</em> as a structure
      that clearly transgresses both temporal and spatial boundaries of
      Horace&#x2019;s lyric here and now.<sup id="fnref:201"><a href="#fn:201" class="footnote">82</a></sup> From a temporal standpoint the
      monument will survive longer than the longest-lasting metal that
      humankind can work.<sup id="fnref:202"><a href="#fn:202" class="footnote">83</a></sup> Nor will it be affected by the physical limits
      of nature as represented by the &#x201C;decaying rain&#x201D; (<em>imber edax</em>, 3) and
      the now &#x201C;powerless&#x201D; wind (<em>impotens</em>, 3); even more impressively, it
      will exist outside of the eternal cycling of seasons (cf.
      <em>innumerabilis</em> / <em>annorum series et fuga temporum</em>, 4-5).<sup id="fnref:203"><a href="#fn:203" class="footnote">84</a></sup> In
      terms of spatial excess, moreover, Horace&#x2019;s monument will be &#x201C;loftier
      than the regal structure of the pyramids&#x201D; (<em>regalique situ pyramidum
      altius</em>, 2).<sup id="fnref:204"><a href="#fn:204" class="footnote">85</a></sup> All this suggests that the <em>monumentum</em> of the poet
      would be perhaps the most stable structure ever constructed in its
      ability to resist those forces &#x2013; gravity and time &#x2013; that ultimately
      destroy all works crafted by humankind.</p>
      
      <p>Yet the monument is at the same time shown to be dynamic. It might well
      seem odd at first that Horace says he will &#x201C;grow&#x201D; (<em>crescam</em>, 8) from
      the praises of posterity. As scholars have suggested, however, the
      imagery here is not inappropriate since the poet and his lyric
      <em>monumentum</em> have &#x201C;imperceptibly&#x201D; become one and the same by this point
      in the poem.<sup id="fnref:205"><a href="#fn:205" class="footnote">86</a></sup> But then the question becomes: &#x201C;How can a stable
      monument grow?&#x201D; This is an issue that has spurred some interesting and
      highly subtle interpretations. Whereas Michael C. J. Putnam argues that
      &#x201C;growth retaining continued freshness, eternity imposed on futurity&#x2026;only
      certifies the initial programme of a <em>monumentum</em> espousing stature
      beyond space and time,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:206"><a href="#fn:206" class="footnote">87</a></sup> Mich&#xE8;le Lowrie suggests that &#x201C;image of a
      breathing monument&#x201D; is able to avoid &#x201C;the stasis of formalism&#x201D; because a
      &#x201C;<em>monumentum</em> (monument, reminder, tomb, literary corpus) is not only a
      piece of architecture, but a speech act.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:207"><a href="#fn:207" class="footnote">88</a></sup> It would seem, however,
      that these scholars are overlooking the straightforward way in which
      Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> is figured in an explicitly physical sense: it has
      materiality (<em>aere perennius</em>, 1); it has physical dimensions
      (<em>regalique situ pyramidum altius</em>, 2).<sup id="fnref:208"><a href="#fn:208" class="footnote">89</a></sup> The poet is employing the
      idea of the monument here, I would argue, because monuments offer a
      tangible feeling of stability that gives their viewers a sense of surety
      against the forces which affect all mortals. The notion that this
      <em>monumentum</em> can overcome those forces does not make it less physical;
      if anything, in fact, Horace&#x2019;s structure is a monument, <em>par
      excellence</em>, in its ability to endure past all bounds. If this is the
      case, though, then there would certainly seem to be a real tension here
      between the stability that Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> as a monument promises
      and his prophecy that it will be eternally dynamic.<sup id="fnref:209"><a href="#fn:209" class="footnote">90</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>That very tension is the point, however. It makes sense for Horace&#x2019;s
      architextural monument to be both stable and dynamic,<sup id="fnref:210"><a href="#fn:210" class="footnote">91</a></sup> for it
      represents a poetics that is itself based on tensions that allow the
      poet to stabilize traditional lyric space while he redefines it. I have
      argued in this chapter that Horace &#x201C;inverts&#x201D; the <em>recusatio</em> in order to
      construct his generic boundaries so that he can incorporate generic
      tensions into its very structure without causing it to crack at the
      foundations, that is, to create a stable lyric structure that can remain
      traditional while still being innovative. That might seem paradoxical &#x2013;
      just as a monument that is stable and yet grows also might appear
      paradoxical. This is not paradox for the sake of paradox, though, or
      some kind of deconstructive dark humor for that matter. It is precisely
      <em>because of</em> the incorporation of these mutual tensions through the
      poem&#x2019;s opposed architextural images that I have suggested Horace&#x2019;s
      poetry can achieve a dynamic enough nature to be <em>simultaneously</em> old
      and new, traditional and innovative.<sup id="fnref:211"><a href="#fn:211" class="footnote">92</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The use of such tensions can be found outside of Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em>, as
      well. The remaining part of this chapter will suggest that understanding
      how Horace constructs his <em>monumentum</em> can also inform one&#x2019;s reading of
      the tensions within the rhetoric of monumentality in the Augustan age
      more broadly.<sup id="fnref:212"><a href="#fn:212" class="footnote">93</a></sup> It is because Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> does not
      represent a compromise but rather a delicate balancing of tensions that
      makes Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em> into a true Augustan monument, that is, one which
      is stable <em>and</em> dynamic,<sup id="fnref:213"><a href="#fn:213" class="footnote">94</a></sup> one which able to signify past tradition
      and present innovation at the same time.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-4-horaces-augustan-monument">Part 4. Horace&#x2019;s Augustan Monument</h3>
      
      <p>In her book on <em>Horace and the Rhetoric of Authority</em>, Ellen Oliensis
      argues that the poet&#x2019;s lyric poetry</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>with its multiple articulations and recurrent arrests, tends to
      concentrate&#x2026;on <em>fines.</em> [&#x2026;] And <em>yet</em> it is just this emphasis
      on limit that lends Horatian lyric an &#x201C;imperial&#x201D; character. The
      peculiar energy that charges Horace&#x2019;s lyric <em>fines</em> both derives from
      and feeds a larger cultural preoccupation with the masterful
      articulation of space.<sup id="fnref:214"><a href="#fn:214" class="footnote">95</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>This &#x201C;cultural preoccupation&#x201D; is of course a reference to what Augustus
      himself was doing to the structure of Rome &#x2013; the physical one as well as
      the one in the Roman imagination. The <em>princeps</em> was pushing the borders
      of the empire farther than ever before. If Rome keeps growing and
      incorporating more and more land and peoples, though, how can Roman
      identity remain stable? That is an important question, no doubt, and one
      that may have entered the minds of those living under Augustus amidst so
      much change. Yet the physical borders of the empire were not the only
      ones that were being redefined. At the same time, and more pertinent to
      the focus of this dissertation, Augustus was redefining the structure of
      the <em>res publica</em>, too, and incorporating into it ingredients and roles
      that were very different from those of the Roman state during its rise
      to power. Could Rome still remain &#x201C;Rome&#x201D; in the midst of so much
      redefinition of its boundaries, outwards as well as from within its
      <em>fines</em>?</p>
      
      <p>Chapter II demonstrated just how important architecture was to the
      Romans&#x2019; conception of the world around them and, in particular, to the
      way that they saw their state. Yet the old structure of Rome was simply
      that, old, and it had fallen into ruin &#x2013; at least, according to Horace
      himself, when he laments that Rome&#x2019;s own architectural structures had
      fallen into disrepair during the civil wars, and with them so had the
      Roman state and its <em>mores</em>.<sup id="fnref:215"><a href="#fn:215" class="footnote">96</a></sup> Coming to this particular situation
      Augustus needed to rebuild Rome, the idea of it as much as its physical
      appearance. For this monumentalization of the city to be successful,
      however, it had to be connected to the foundations of Rome&#x2019;s past.
      Augustus could not simply disregard the old structure of the republic,
      in other words, even as he built his new one in the form of the
      principate.</p>
      
      <p>This chapter has teased out some of the nuances of Horace&#x2019;s rhetorical
      strategies in his attempt to redefine &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric dimensions
      through a balancing of tensions. It is interesting (and perhaps even
      illuminating) to see what this approach can tell us about the careful
      words that the <em>princeps</em> used to articulate his own revitalization of
      traditional Roman &#x201C;structures&#x201D; in the <em>Res Gestae</em> through a similar
      balancing of tensions. The Augustan program needed to be traditional and
      yet new, republican and yet imperial. The <em>princeps</em> protests, too, in
      favor of the traditional structures upon which Rome had been founded. At
      the same time &#x2013; and just like Horace &#x2013; by keeping old and new systems in
      subtle tension with each other he simultaneously integrates into these
      structures a novel system of power without outwardly appearing to
      destabilize the old foundations; if anything, in fact, it allows the
      <em>princeps</em> to revitalize them, even as he introduces dramatic changes to
      the republican structure.<sup id="fnref:216"><a href="#fn:216" class="footnote">97</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>There are numerous sections in the monumental inscription of the <em>Res
      Gestae</em> where a reader can find Augustus refusing to accept novel honors
      and titles. In <em>RGDA</em> 6, for example, Augustus claims that he &#x201C;did not
      receive any magistracy offered against the custom of his ancestors,&#x201D;
      even though it was what he claims the senate and Roman people wanted for
      him.<sup id="fnref:217"><a href="#fn:217" class="footnote">98</a></sup> This comes at the end of a long list of &#x201C;<em>res non gestae</em>&#x201D;
      which &#x2013; according to Walter Eder &#x2013; &#x201C;serve[s] only to profile the
      <em>princeps</em> as the incorruptible guardian of tradition who took care,
      even against the will of Senate and People, not to contradict the
      constitution of the fathers.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:218"><a href="#fn:218" class="footnote">99</a></sup> That seems to be correct, at least
      on the surface. But it would also seem that if Augustus constantly goes
      against the will of the Senate and People he is making just as much of a
      statement about his power and its innovative nature. He neither needs
      nor desires honors such as the consulship (or worse the dictatorship)
      that represented the height of the republican <em>cursus honorum</em>.<sup id="fnref:219"><a href="#fn:219" class="footnote">100</a></sup>
      And so he can &#x201C;refuse&#x201D; receiving them in an untraditional way. As Horace
      with his ambitious builders transgressing the boundaries of his
      traditional lyric time and space, so too Augustus with his subjects
      offering to him what they should not. The transgression appears to be
      all theirs, not his. By employing the rhetoric of the inverted
      <em>recusatio</em> here &#x2013; by being the active refuser of something seemingly
      untraditional &#x2013; the <em>princeps</em> is able to show his respect for past
      traditions while simultaneously communicating that his new system no
      longer requires them.</p>
      
      <p>Refusing honors in this way was not the only manner in which Augustus
      was successful in carefully articulating the transformation of Rome from
      the old republic to the new principate through the use of an inverted
      <em>recusatio</em>. The more significant examples for the purposes of this
      chapter concern what Augustus has to say in his <em>Res Gestae</em> about his
      own building program. The <em>princeps</em> lists several of his architectural
      efforts in Chapters 19, 20, and 21,<sup id="fnref:220"><a href="#fn:220" class="footnote">101</a></sup> which is provided in its

        <p><strong>19.</strong> I built the curia and the chalcidicum next to it and the
      temple of Apollo on the Palatine with its porticoes, the temple of the
      divine Julius, the Lupercal, the portico near the Circus Flaminius,
      which I allowed to be called Octavian from the name of him who had
      first built it in that same place, the Pulvinar at the Circus Maximus,
      the temples on the Capitoline of Jupiter Feretrius and of Jupiter
      Tonans, the temple of Quirinus, the temples of Minerva and of Queen
      Juno and of Jupiter on the Aventine, the temple of the Lares on the

        <p><strong>20.</strong> I renovated the Capitolium and the Theatre of Pompey &#x2013; each
      work at a great cost &#x2013; without any inscription of my name. I renovated
      the aqueducts in several places where they were falling apart because
      of old age and I doubled the aqueduct which is called the Marcian by
      letting a new spring into its stream. I finished the Forum Julium and
      the basilica which was between the temple of Castor and the temple of
      Saturn &#x2013; works having been begun and advanced far by my father &#x2013; and I
      began under the title of the name of my sons work on the same basilica
      which had been destroyed by a fire, with the base of it having been
      increased in size, and I ordered it to be finished by my heirs if I
      did not finish it while I was alive. I renovated 82 temples of the
      gods in the city as consul for the sixth time on the authority of the
      senate &#x2013; with not one having been passed over which needed to be
      renovated at the time. As consul for a seventh time I renovated the
      Via Flaminia from the city to Arminium, as well as all the bridges
      except the Mulvian and Minucian.</p>
      
        <p><strong>21.</strong> On private ground I built the temple of Mars Ultor and the
      Forum Augustum from my plunder. I built a theatre near the temple of
      Apollo on ground for the most part having been bought from private
      citizens, which would be in the name of my son-in-law, Marcellus. I
      consecrated gifts from public spoils on the Capitolium, on the temple
      of divine Julius,on the temple of Vesta, and on the temple of Mars
      Ultor, which cost me around 100 million sesterces. When I was consul
      for a fifth time I sent back 35,000 pounds of crown-gold although the
      municipalities and colonies of Italy were offering it for my triumphs,
      and afterwards, each single time I was called imperator, I did not
      accept crown-gold, even though the municipalities and colonies were
      decreeing it as kindly as they had decreed it previously.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>I have cited the whole list here to demonstrate that while it might be
      impressive in length and content the style in which Augustus talks about
      his buildings is rather understated. For all the structures he claims to
      have built (<em>feci</em>), rebuilt (<em>refeci</em>), or completed (<em>perfeci</em>), there
      is almost no description of them &#x2013; of their height, of their material,
      or of really anything specific about their quality. He does mention
      their costs a few times, but their physical nature as buildings is
      dramatically underplayed. There is certainly nothing too explicit in his
      language about how their impressive quality has increased the <em>maiestas</em>
      of Rome, as Vitruvius claims in the preface to his <em>De architectura</em>
      analyzed above in Chapter II.<sup id="fnref:221"><a href="#fn:221" class="footnote">102</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This passage is certainly in keeping with the at times rather
      undescriptive language of many an inscription.<sup id="fnref:222"><a href="#fn:222" class="footnote">103</a></sup> And anyone reading
      in Rome, at least, would of course have the physical buildings
      themselves at which to marvel.<sup id="fnref:223"><a href="#fn:223" class="footnote">104</a></sup> However, the way that Augustus
      simply lists, without much detail at all, the structures that
      contributed to the incredible transformation which he has brought about
      to the city of Rome seems almost <em>too</em> modest, especially when compared
      to Augustus&#x2019; own famous boast recorded by Suetonius to have left Rome a
      city of marble,<sup id="fnref:224"><a href="#fn:224" class="footnote">105</a></sup> or Strabo&#x2019;s over-the-top praise of the Campus
      Martius in Book 3 of his <em>Geography</em>,<sup id="fnref:225"><a href="#fn:225" class="footnote">106</a></sup> or even Vergil&#x2019;s allusions
      to the golden-roofed Capitoline temple in Book 8 of the <em>Aeneid</em>.<sup id="fnref:226"><a href="#fn:226" class="footnote">107</a></sup>
      Augustus does mention amounts of gold and other materials elsewhere in
      the inscription. At the end of Chapter 21 (cited above), for example, he
      speaks of the donation of 100 million sesterces that he made, as well as
      the 35,000 pounds of &#x201C;crown-gold&#x201D; that he &#x201C;refused&#x201D; to take from the
      Italian colonies. Perhaps it should not be surprising, though, that
      Augustus picks the end of his architectural deeds to insert these many
      &#x201C;refusals&#x201D; to accept all the crown-gold offered to him: in the language
      of the <em>Res Gestae</em> neither &#x201C;heads&#x201D; of Rome &#x2013; that is, the Capitoline or
      Augustus&#x2019; &#x2013; are to be depicted with their respective golden crowns. To
      depict them as such would be out of line with tradition.<sup id="fnref:227"><a href="#fn:227" class="footnote">108</a></sup> To show
      restraint in his words and actions grants the <em>princeps</em>, on the other
      hand, the opportunity to allude to the image of these novelties within
      <em>Res Gestae</em> even while seeming to downplay or reject them. Augustus can
      thus create a subtle tension in his <em>Res Gestae</em> that helps him to
      articulate his new powers through the actions of others without going
      outside the traditions of the past himself.</p>
      
      <p>Augustus achieves this tension in other ways, as well, through his
      building program itself. He does not merely build under his own name,
      for instance, but often does so under that of another. In the most
      telling example of this non-naming Augustus claims to have &#x201C;renovated&#x201D;
      the Theatre of Pompey &#x201C;without any inscription of my [i.e., Augustus&#x2019;]
      name&#x201D; (<em>refeci sine ulla inscriptione nominis mei</em>, <em>RGDA</em> 20) &#x2013; a
      statement which receives additional emphasis from its placement after
      the verb <em>refeci</em>.<sup id="fnref:228"><a href="#fn:228" class="footnote">109</a></sup> It is not restraint that compels Augustus to
      behave in this manner. This &#x201C;refusal&#x201D; instead demonstrates that Augustus
      does not need to use the republican tradition of inscribing buildings
      with one&#x2019;s name if he so chooses. Why? Because his power goes beyond
      simple republican display. Inscribing every building with one&#x2019;s own name
      &#x2013; that was part of Pompey&#x2019;s and Caesar&#x2019;s strategy, just as it was for
      many a Roman aristocrat before them. It can be assumed that every Roman
      knew exactly who was responsible for these buildings whether the name of
      the <em>princeps</em> was there or not. Augustus stresses in this passage that
      he has kept the physical structures of the past intact in his
      reconstruction of the city; he goes out of his way, in fact, to
      emphasize that he has repaired all the temples in Rome that needed it
      (cf. <em>nullo praetermisso quod e</em>[<em>o</em>] <em>tempore</em> [<em>refici
      debeba</em>]<em>t</em>, <em>RGDA</em> 20). By discussing this reconstruction as he does
      in his <em>Res Gestae</em>, however, the <em>princeps</em> can show how these
      structures take on new meaning under the principate, even if &#x2013; or rather
      <em>because</em> &#x2013; he &#x201C;refuses&#x201D; to change their form, or add his name in place
      of the original builder.</p>
      
      <p>The <em>princeps</em> built more than anyone else has. That much is clear from
      the lengthy passage cited above.<sup id="fnref:229"><a href="#fn:229" class="footnote">110</a></sup> His description does not stress
      that he is building <em>differently</em> from his predecessors, however. And
      the particular strategy of &#x201C;refusal&#x201D; that he employs here &#x2013; whereby he
      actively denies to himself the power or recognition that he has already
      gained &#x2013; should be familiar now from the above examination of Horace&#x2019;s
      <em>Odes</em> in this chapter. Indeed, as with the poet&#x2019;s lyric, the genius of
      Augustus&#x2019; redefinition of Rome was that his refusals to change it
      actually allowed him to articulate that he had. The monumentalization of
      Rome as described in the <em>Res Gestae</em> is conveyed not through blatant
      statements of transformation, but rather in the implications that lie
      behind, and are almost contradictory to, what his words claim in the
      inscription. And like the poet Augustus used this tension to respect the
      past &#x2013; to redefine and revitalize Roman traditions &#x2013; while
      simultaneously constructing something new.</p>
      
      <p>By thus reconstructing the traditional borders of Rome&#x2019;s structure,
      physically as well as metaphorically, the <em>princeps</em> could stabilize
      what it meant to be a good traditional Roman while in some ways
      dramatically departing from what it had meant in the republic. This is
      only possible, however, because he has injected his architectural
      discourse with a stabilizing tension between the new and the
      traditional. Augustus does not have choose between what was conventional
      and what was not: he can have both <em>simultaneously</em> by delicately
      balancing them in tension with each other. The Augustan age was not just
      a period in which Rome&#x2019;s traditional structures were redefined; just as
      important, it was also an age of redefining <em>how</em> one can define such
      structures in the first place.</p>
      
      <p>This chapter has demonstrated why the lyric <em>monumentum</em> in finale of
      the <em>Odes</em> is perhaps the perfect architextural structure for
      representing his first collection of lyric poetry. Horace builds up the
      tensions on which it is based from the start &#x2013; transgressive structure
      by transgressive structure, inverted <em>recusatio</em> by inverted
      <em>recusatio</em>. The tensions that emerge in contrasting his Sabine farm to
      these transgressive structures allowed him <em>both</em> to establish a
      &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; structure for his lyric <em>and</em> to bring novel material
      inside of it. This rhetorical strategy should not be seen as deceitful
      in some way: from the start Horace has been proclaiming &#x2013; albeit through
      &#x201C;refusing&#x201D; &#x2013; his poetry&#x2019;s innovative, dynamic nature from within its
      &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; lyric bounds.</p>
      
      <p>How does understanding the way that Horace builds his &#x201C;monument&#x201D; give us
      insight into the architectural discourse of the monumentalization of
      Augustan Rome? It might be tempting at first to suggest that in <em>C</em>.
      3.30 Horace is in some way &#x201C;exposing&#x201D; and thereby subtly criticizing the
      &#x201C;delicate&#x201D; nature of Augustus&#x2019; rhetorical strategy.<sup id="fnref:230"><a href="#fn:230" class="footnote">111</a></sup> But that
      interpretation would suggest that the parallel is entirely intentional &#x2013;
      and, more importantly, quite limited in its aims. We can never know for
      certain how conscious Horace was of the parallel, let alone whether he
      meant it negatively.<sup id="fnref:231"><a href="#fn:231" class="footnote">112</a></sup> In his book on Augustan culture Karl Galinsky
      has suggested a more nuanced way of understanding the sense of a &#x201C;shared
      direction&#x201D; between the poet and the <em>princeps</em>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>It would be futile to fall back on the schematic explanation that one
      man &#x201C;influenced&#x201D; the other or, worse yet, to relapse into the
      hierarchical model according to which Horace takes orders from
      Octavian. Rather, what we see here at an early stage, long before
      Augustus&#x2019; expanding <em>auctoritas,</em> is a sense of shared direction. Its
      elaboration is left to the inclination and creativity of the
      individuals. This accounts for another characteristic that the
      implementations of both Horace and Augustus have in common: neither is
      content with simply replicating&#x2026; Rather, both turn their creative
      energies to surpassing the model and giving it a meaning of their own.
      It is a process that is profoundly characteristic of Augustan culture.
      [&#x2026;] Horace, instead of being a mere imperial versifier, carries on a
      creative dialogue with the Augustan milieu. He reacts to some of its
      ideas and reshapes them in his own way. Above all, he is never
      passive.<sup id="fnref:232"><a href="#fn:232" class="footnote">113</a></sup></p>

      <p>One does not have to accept Galinsky&#x2019;s seemingly all-encompassing idea
      of <em>auctoritas</em> for his approach here to have validity. What we can
      reasonably say given the findings of this chapter is that Horace&#x2019;s
      <em>Odes</em> taps into the rhetorical strategies of the Augustan age in which
      a &#x201C;refusal&#x201D; to condone modifications to a traditional structures
      actually granted existence to those same innovations as part of the
      structure itself &#x2013; innovations which in turn revitalized the structure.</p>
      
      <p>Horace did not write an epic for the <em>princeps</em>. Nor did he need to. His
      lyric <em>monumentum</em> is an especially fitting contribution to Augustus&#x2019;
      monumentalization of Rome: it represents for us the kind of claim
      through architectural imagery that Augustus could not make explicitly
      because to make it would in a sense disrupt the perfect balance of
      republic and imperial power that the &#x201C;refusals&#x201D; themselves had already
      allowed the <em>princeps</em> to assume. The poet could decide without too much
      anxiety to build his immortalizing monument while alive. He had little
      to fear (besides perhaps ridicule) by proclaiming his own poetic
      &#x201C;apotheosis&#x201D; at the end of the first publication of his <em>Odes</em>. For
      obvious reasons such was not the case for the <em>princeps</em>, who smartly
      waited until after he died to let himself be deified in Rome. The point
      is that Augustus did not have to say he would become immortal for it to
      happen. And we can imagine that even without <em>C</em>. 3.30 much the same
      could be said about Horace and his forever stable yet eternally dynamic
      lyric <em>monumentum</em>.</p>

            <p>Something similar might be said in relation to the poem at the

      up anticipating in a sense the poet&#x2019;s own transgressive desire to

      architectural references, it is outside the scope of this study. I
      would tentatively suggest, however, that <em>C</em>. 1.1 as a whole might
      itself be anticipating the entire rest of the first three books of
      the <em>Odes</em> in which the very sort of building activity that Horace
      seems to reject throughout is ultimately taken up by him in the
      finale in the form of his <em>monumentum</em>. See also Musurillo 1962 for

            <p>My argument again is not so much interested in how Horace is
      engaging with the monuments of the Augustan age as it is in how he
      plays a part in creating the discourse surrounding monuments in
      general. For Horace&#x2019; interaction &#x2013; or rather lack thereof &#x2013; with
      actual Augustan monuments see Hardie 1993, 126, claiming that
      &#x201C;[o]ne reason for Horace&#x2019;s reluctance to evoke actual monuments in
      his verse is the desire to establish his own words as an
      alternative, and superior, kind of monument,&#x201D; and Jaeger 1995, 191,
      where she argues that &#x201C;[b]y circumventing the buildings to focus
      attention on the ephemeral and the permanent [in <em>C</em>. 1.8],
      [Horace] has celebrated the place while maintaining his own
      standards for his chosen genre.&#x201D; Despite the lack of Roman monuments
      in Horace&#x2019;s poems I find Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 26, to be right
      in suggesting that &#x201C;Horace is the first poet who shows clear signs
      of being deeply affected by&#x2026;changes in the experiential fabric of
      Rome,&#x201D; especially given all the attention he bestows upon

      the open/stormy sea, however. The space can be a metaphor for
      violent erotic passion, as well, and thus a location suitable for
      more elegiac themes. In <em>C</em>. 1.5, for instance, the poet compares
      Pyrrha&#x2019;s love to &#x201C;harsh waters&#x201D; (<em>aspera</em>&#x2026;<em>aequora</em>, 5-6) for any
      inexperienced lover of hers. Vessey 1984, 486, argues that &#x201C;Pyrrha
      herself, the golden Pyrrha, has the <em>gracilis puer</em> in her arms at
      the outset of a voyage that must prove disastrous to him, though not
      to her; neither she nor the sea ever changes or disappears. Only
      experience can teach her victims that all that glistens is not gold
      so that, soaked and buffeted by the waves of her perfidy, they at
      last retire from the life of love&#x2026;&#x201D; This interpretation has led
      some scholars &#x2013; mistaking elegiac space for actual erotic
      circumstance &#x2013; to see the ship in <em>C</em>. 1.14 as an allegory for a

      amatory (mis)adventure. See Anderson 1966, Woodman 1980, and Knorr

      together&#x201D; (91). Zumwalt 1978-1979 builds upon this point and argues

      the end of the recently issued second <em>Georgic</em>, which in the same
      philosophical tradition had drawn a contrast between the happiness
      of farmers and the pomp of the rich&#x201D; (cf. Verg. <em>G</em>. 2.461 ff.). <a href="#fnref:185" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

      therefore, it is possible to detect at least a sideways
      acknowledgement of the attractions of such unnatural luxuries.&#x201D;

            <p>H&#xF6;lscher 2006, 241, suggests that there is a &#x201C;presentness&#x201D; in
      Augustan culture that &#x201C;seems difficult to reconcile with a
      fundamentally retrospective orientation toward an all-dominating
      past.&#x201D; As he argues, however, &#x201C;[t]he artistic forms served the
      specific statement &#x2013; and this statement was not at all
      retrospective, but contemporary and actual.&#x201D; It is not that the
      Romans are obsessed with the past, for H&#xF6;lscher, but that they use
      the forms of that past as &#x201C;universal cultural instrument[s]&#x201D; to
      produce a &#x201C;vivid expression of contemporary concepts&#x201D; (258, 244).
      From a non-classicist perspective Hirsch 1995, 23, claims that the
      &#x201C;tension between tradition and the modern&#x201D; can be &#x201C;momentarily
      resolved in a representation that encapsulates the political fiction
      of a unified nation.&#x201D; I would argue that the unresolved tensions of
      the Augustan age can be just as effective in a creating a powerful
      political fiction. <a href="#fnref:216" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>
