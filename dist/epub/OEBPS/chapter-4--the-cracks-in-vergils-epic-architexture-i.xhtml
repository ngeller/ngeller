    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4. The Cracks in Vergil&#x2019;s Epic Architexture I</h2>
    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>Horace is not the only or the first Augustan poet to predict his
      &#x201C;immortality&#x201D; &#x2013; or to do so by imagining his poetry as a monumental
      edifice. Vergil had already done as much in the celebrated proem that
      begins the second half of his <em>Georgics</em>, as the below excerpt from Book
      3 of the poem demonstrates:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
      tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
      primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
      Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas;
      primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
      et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
      propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
      Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.
      in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit (<em>G</em>. 3.8-16)<sup id="fnref:233"><a href="#fn:233" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>I must attempt a path by which I too might be able to lift myself from
      the ground and fly victorious through the mouths of men. I returning
      to my native land shall be the first &#x2013; provided that I live long
      enough &#x2013; to lead back with me the Muses from the Aonian peak; I shall
      be the first to carry back the Idumean palms to you, Mantua, and I
      will establish a temple of marble in a green field near the water,
      where the great Mincius wanders, slowly curving, and covers its banks
      with tender reeds. In the middle of my temple will be Caesar, and he
      will possess it.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>It is clear from the first two lines of this passage (cf.
      <em>temptanda</em>&#x2026;<em>ora</em>, 8-9) that Vergil too is speaking of achieving
      immortality through his poetry.<sup id="fnref:234"><a href="#fn:234" class="footnote">2</a></sup> And like Horace he uses the image
      of a monumental structure to stake his claim to it. &#x201C;I will establish a
      temple of marble&#x201D; (<em>templum de marmore ponam</em>, 13), the Mantuan poet
      proclaims to his readers, a temple to Augustus Caesar (cf. <em>in</em>
      <em>medio&#x2026;Caesar erit templumque tenebit</em>, 16). There is one significant
      and obvious difference, of course, between the respective poetic
      statements of these two poets: Horace has already built his monument
      (<em>exegi monumentum</em>&#x2026;, <em>C</em>. 3.30.1) when he announces his claim to
      immortality while Vergil has yet to erect his &#x201C;epic&#x201D; temple, using only
      future verbs (<em>ponam</em>, 13; <em>tenebit</em>, 16) throughout the description of
      the building.</p>
      
      <p>Although it is not hard to understand why this monumental temple has
      been read as a metaphor for what the <em>Aeneid</em> would become,<sup id="fnref:235"><a href="#fn:235" class="footnote">3</a></sup> the
      goal of this chapter and the next one is not to decide whether or not
      this particular structure should be seen as somehow representative of
      the exact epic poem that Vergil would end up writing. Nor will I undergo
      an extensive analysis of the very complex images of this proem from the
      <em>Georgics</em>.<sup id="fnref:236"><a href="#fn:236" class="footnote">4</a></sup> I briefly mention Vergil&#x2019;s temple here at the start
      only to point out two important elements for a study of his architexture
      in the <em>Aeneid</em>. First, this passage demonstrates explicitly that the
      poet employs the imagery of architecture &#x2013; and in particular monumental,
      public architecture &#x2013; in order to give concrete form to his poetics.
      Epic for Vergil is represented here as a grand, seemingly stable
      structure &#x201C;of marble&#x201D; (<em>de marmore</em>, 13) in an idyllic, peaceful setting
      (13-14). The proem to <em>Georgics</em> 3 is thus significant for establishing
      monumental architecture as an operative metaphor for Vergil&#x2019;s epic
      poetry, especially since he is not nearly so explicit in the <em>Aeneid</em> as
      Horace is in his <em>Odes</em> when the latter states that his poem is a
      <em>monumentum</em>. Second, whereas Horace speaks only of his monument&#x2019;s
      impenetrable exterior and its apparently impervious nature,<sup id="fnref:237"><a href="#fn:237" class="footnote">5</a></sup> the
      poet of the <em>Georgics</em> lets us see inside his temple, right to the
      statue of Augustus Caesar at its center. And it is this focus on what
      lies behind the surface of structures that marks a notable difference in
      Vergil&#x2019;s own architexture when it comes to his epic.<sup id="fnref:238"><a href="#fn:238" class="footnote">6</a></sup> The
      <em>princeps</em> might possess the temple here in the <em>Georgics</em> in a way that
      gives stability to the building&#x2019;s meaning through his &#x201C;numinous power&#x201D;
      in contrast to the allusive depictions of civil war on the exterior of
      its doors.<sup id="fnref:239"><a href="#fn:239" class="footnote">7</a></sup> In the <em>Aeneid</em>, however, the interiors of many of the
      poem&#x2019;s structures are much darker, I argue, and filled with forces that
      seek to destabilize order rather than impose it. One of the main
      architextural images of the poem &#x2013; the Temple of Janus (<em>Aen</em>.
      1.293-296) &#x2013; is possessed not by an Augustus, in fact, but rather by the
      <em>furor impius</em> of Rome&#x2019;s past which while temporarily bound seems eager
      to break free at any moment.</p>
      
      <p>The previous chapter examined how Horace constructs generic boundaries
      that while purporting to keep out extrageneric space and time actually
      incorporate them within his traditional lyric dimensions. This way of
      constructing a dynamic and innovative kind of lyric monument through
      what I have termed an inverted <em>recusatio</em> was shown to parallel the
      kind of rhetoric that Augustus also employs in his <em>Res Gestae</em> when
      speaking of his architectural productions in the Roman cityscape. In
      both cases, I argued, the structures created are not as traditional as
      they might first appear; they become enhanced rather by their ability to
      take on the meaning that they claim to exclude through rhetorical
      disavowals. These structures &#x2013; whether poetic, political, or real &#x2013; thus
      achieve a dual nature of being old and new simultaneously, with a
      delicate but perfect balancing of tensions between those two extremes.</p>
      
      <p>The analysis of the <em>Aeneid</em> in this dissertation will examine the way
      that Vergil takes the architexture of Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> and flips
      our perspective: the epic poet looks not at the extrageneric forces that
      Horace balances against his lyric traditional structure to enhance its
      stability, but rather at the chaos from Rome&#x2019;s past that threatens the
      stability of his epic poem <em>qua</em> &#x201C;monument&#x201D; from <em>within</em> its
      structure.<sup id="fnref:240"><a href="#fn:240" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The ability of a monument to hide something disruptive
      rather than simply keep out what is inappropriate thus sets the stage
      for a much different understanding of monuments and generic boundaries
      than the one arrived at for Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em>. Can the <em>Aeneid</em> with its
      epic facade provide a stable frame for a teleological narrative from
      Aeneas to Augustus?<sup id="fnref:241"><a href="#fn:241" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Can it successfully conceal beneath its
      magnificent surface the chaotic violence of Rome&#x2019;s past from its very
      origins to Vergil&#x2019;s present? And what does the poem&#x2019;s success or failure
      in these regards tell us about the idea of the monument in the Augustan
      age? Those are the primary questions that will be asked in this chapter,
      as well as the next one.</p>
      
      <p>My concern will therefore not be to analyze the idea of the city in the
      poem as a &#x201C;poetological metaphor&#x201D; for the text.<sup id="fnref:242"><a href="#fn:242" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Nor will I focus
      on the allusions to actual Augustan monuments, as has been the custom of
      many examinations of the poem when discussing architecture&#x2019;s place in
      it.<sup id="fnref:243"><a href="#fn:243" class="footnote">11</a></sup> I am not attempting, moreover, to analyze closely how the poem
      helps us to understand better the visual aesthetics of actual Roman
      architectural monuments.<sup id="fnref:244"><a href="#fn:244" class="footnote">12</a></sup> What I aim to do is to explore how the
      poem engages with the monumental discourse of Augustan Rome &#x2013; not only
      employing it to articulate what an epic monument like the <em>Aeneid</em> can
      and cannot do, but at the same time also exploring the strengths and
      weaknesses of the discourse itself in relation to Rome&#x2019;s past, present,
      and future.<sup id="fnref:245"><a href="#fn:245" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The discussion of the poem along these lines will be divided across two
      chapters due to the vast amount of material in the <em>Aeneid</em> that could
      be analyzed for these purposes. I will leave aside the poem&#x2019;s named
      <em>monumenta</em> for Chapter V in order to provide a context for them first
      by focusing in this present chapter on the poem&#x2019;s recurring theme of
      &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architecture. I use the term &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architecture here to
      refer to edifices that ultimately do not contain the chaos of the past
      that they were built to conceal, but rather release it when their
      boundaries become compromised, whether literally or
      metaphorically.<sup id="fnref:246"><a href="#fn:246" class="footnote">14</a></sup> These constructions consist most notably of
      certain caves and labyrinths in the poem, examined below in Part 1 and
      Part 2, respectively. The former of this pair comprises not &#x201C;natural&#x201D;
      caves, one should note, but <em>moles</em> &#x2013; unnatural, constructed objects
      that are erected to contain the chaos which the <em>Aeneid</em> reveals to be a
      central part of Roman history from the start. These include Aeolus&#x2019; Cave
      in Book 1, the Trojan Horse in Book 2 (which is also described several
      times as a &#x201C;cave&#x201D;), and the Cave of Cacus in Book 8. With an examination
      of the labyrinths in Books 5 and 6 of the poem I will transition in Part
      2 to structures whose failure to restrain the chaotic forces of the past
      occurs at a less literal level: the walls of the labyrinths are not
      broken, <em>per se</em>, but are revealed to be always shifting and thus unable
      to contain within themselves the past disorders and mistakes (<em>errores</em>)
      they were designed to keep hidden. The point of this chapter will
      therefore be to illustrate how such structures fail to maintain not just
      their physical boundaries, but in the case of labyrinths often their
      &#x201C;epistemological&#x201D; boundaries, as well, since what they appear to mean on
      the outside is shown to be just as susceptible to collapse as their
      material structure.<sup id="fnref:247"><a href="#fn:247" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

      <p><strong>Augustan temple (Brescia, Italy)</strong></p>
      
      <p><br/></p>
      
      <p>Before we begin to look at these &#x201C;failed&#x201D; structures, however, let us
      briefly return to where this chapter began. The immense scholarly
      attention given to the passage from the <em>Georgics</em> quoted at the start
      of this chapter points to something else which it is important to keep
      in mind during the following examination of Vergil&#x2019;s architexture:
      whatever the poet might have meant his temple to signify at the time
      that he wrote the proem, it has not stopped future scholars from
      bestowing their own interpretations on it &#x2013; and thus transforming the
      meaning of the structure into anything from an &#x201C;abandoned project&#x201D; to
      the <em>Aeneid</em> itself.<sup id="fnref:248"><a href="#fn:248" class="footnote">16</a></sup> The present chapter and the following one
      will explore how the architexture of the <em>Aeneid</em> illustrates that such
      an instability of meaning is not only inherent to monumentality, as was
      suggested above in Chapter II;<sup id="fnref:249"><a href="#fn:249" class="footnote">17</a></sup> more importantly, the poem
      demonstrates the need for one always to be aware of this instability
      when &#x201C;reading&#x201D; <em>monumenta</em> &#x2013; whether poetic ones, such as the <em>Aeneid</em>,
      or real ones in Rome&#x2019;s physical landscape, such as the Temple of Janus.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-1-the-constructed-caves-of-the-aeneid">Part 1. The Constructed Caves of the <em>Aeneid</em></h3>
      
      <p>A cave is normally a natural &#x201C;place&#x201D; with firm boundaries that separate
      inside from outside,<sup id="fnref:250"><a href="#fn:250" class="footnote">18</a></sup> distinguish light from dark,<sup id="fnref:251"><a href="#fn:251" class="footnote">19</a></sup> and can
      even house primordial forces that defy rationalization and
      structure.<sup id="fnref:252"><a href="#fn:252" class="footnote">20</a></sup> For the Romans, however, caves could be constructed, as
      well, and in a way that blurred those seemingly rigid boundaries.<sup id="fnref:253"><a href="#fn:253" class="footnote">21</a></sup>
      In the case of decorated grottoes, for instance, aristocrats and
      emperors could enjoy nature in safety and under their control as part of
      their domain &#x2013; thus breaking down the distinction between the natural
      and the artificial.<sup id="fnref:254"><a href="#fn:254" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In their poetry, moreover, Roman authors used
      caves in a similar way to destabilize the boundaries of what is crafted
      and what is untouched by human beings. In Vergil&#x2019;s bucolic poems, for
      example, Frederick Jones has recently shown how caves are one of the
      &#x201C;various apparently natural features in the <em>Eclogues</em> [that] turn out
      not to be unequivocally natural&#x201D;; according to Jones, in fact, caves
      play an important role as an &#x201C;element of bucolic iconography,&#x201D;
      representing an ideal space for bucolic song that is at once natural and
      artificial.<sup id="fnref:255"><a href="#fn:255" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> examined below are not entirely natural,
      either. They are constructions &#x2013; <em>moles</em> &#x2013; imposed upon nature to
      contain the destructive, chaotic forces of the past that seek to escape
      and upset the established order of things.<sup id="fnref:256"><a href="#fn:256" class="footnote">24</a></sup> It is the way that
      these caves <em>fail</em> to keep such forces at bay, however, that makes them
      relevant to a discussion of Vergilian architexture. It is not merely
      that they become a marked space for epic song; they help rather to
      illustrate what happens when someone &#x2013; whether a god, an emperor, or a
      poet &#x2013; attempts to impose a structure upon the chaotic forces of the
      past that exist as part of Rome&#x2019;s history from its very origins. The
      role of caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> is thus two-fold: they are simultaneously
      architectural in the way they try to restrain the violence of the past
      and <em>anti</em>-architectural in the sense that their own failure to do so
      illustrates the very fragility of such restraints.<sup id="fnref:257"><a href="#fn:257" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
      
      <h4 id="i-aeolus-cave">(i) Aeolus&#x2019; Cave</h4>
      
      <p>When readers (ancient or modern) come to Aeolus&#x2019; Cave in Book I of the
      <em>Aeneid</em> they might have certain expectations based on the passage in
      Homer&#x2019;s <em>Odyssey</em> where Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag full of winds in
      order to make his journey back home a little easier. Those expectations
      are quickly disappointed, however.<sup id="fnref:258"><a href="#fn:258" class="footnote">26</a></sup> And the dramatic changes which
      Vergil makes to his Homeric model provide a useful starting point for an
      examination of an architectural feature in the form of constructed caves
      that appears again and again in his epic poem.</p>
      
      <p>Let us start by comparing the two structures that Aeolus inhabits in
      each poem. Below is a short excerpt from Homer that describes Aeolus&#x2019;
      domain and activities in the <em>Odyssey</em>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>We reached the island of Aeolia. There lived
      Aeolus Hippotades, dear to gods immortal,
      on a floating island, a wall of unbreakable bronze
      all around it, and the smooth rock ran sheer up.
      His twelve children were also in the palace,</p>
      
        <p>[&#x2026;]</p>
      
        <p>They always dine beside their dear father and devoted mother.
      Countless good things lie beside them, and the house,
      steaming with sacrifice, echoes around the courtyard 10
      by day, and at night they sleep again beside their venerable wives
      in blankets and in corded beds.<sup id="fnref:259"><a href="#fn:259" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Homer&#x2019;s Aeolus lives in a palace (&#x1F10;&#x3BD;&#x1F76; &#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3AC;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;, 5) with his twelve
      children &#x2013; a place of constant feasting and merriment where Odysseus and
      his comrades spend a month enjoying the king&#x2019;s hospitality while telling
      of their journey thus far. The &#x201C;wall of unbreakable bronze&#x201D; (&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x1FD6;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
      &#x3C7;&#x3AC;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x1F04;&#x3C1;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;, 3) and &#x201C;sheer&#x201D; rock cliffs (cf. &#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C3;&#x1F74;&#x2026;&#x3C0;&#x3AD;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;, 4) that
      surround Aeolus&#x2019; kingdom are clearly intended to be barriers to keep
      others out of this small piece of paradise.<sup id="fnref:260"><a href="#fn:260" class="footnote">28</a></sup> Vergil gives us a
      rather different picture of Aeolus&#x2019; &#x201C;kingdom&#x201D; when he narrates Juno&#x2019;s
      visit there early in Book 1 of the <em>Aeneid</em>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Talia flammato secum dea corde uolutans
      nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus Austris,
      Aeoliam uenit. hic uasto rex Aeolus antro
      luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras
      imperio premit ac uinclis et carcere frenat.
      illi indignantes magna cum murmure montis
      circum claustra fremunt. (Verg. <em>Aen</em>. 1.50-56)</p>
      
        <p>Debating such things with herself in her inflamed heart the goddess
      arrived at Aeolia, the land of the storm-clouds, places filled with
      raging southwest winds. Here in a vast cave Aeolus as king keeps in
      check the winds struggling to break free and the boisterous storms,
      and restrains them in chains and a prison. They angrily roar at their
      bonds as the mountain rumbles loudly.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Aeolus&#x2019; country is certainly no island paradise in the <em>Aeneid</em>, but
      instead is a place &#x201C;filled with raging southwest winds&#x201D; (<em>feta
      furentibus Austris</em>, 51). His home is still immense &#x2013; but only a cave
      (<em>uasto&#x2026;antro</em>, 52).<sup id="fnref:261"><a href="#fn:261" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Aeolus&#x2019; companions are not his family,
      moreover, but &#x201C;winds struggling to break free and boisterous storms&#x201D;
      (<em>luctantis uentos tempestatesque sonoras</em>, 53), which he must keep
      under control in a sort of &#x201C;prison&#x201D; (<em>carcere</em>, 54). And even then these
      unwilling inhabitants continue to roar at the constraints that bind them
      (<em>indignantes&#x2026;circum claustra fremunt</em>, 55-56). This island prison is
      certainly not the impression one gets from Aeolus&#x2019; palace in the
      <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
      
      <p>I will return to examine more fully the nature of the architecture in
      this passage below. It is important, however, to consider beforehand
      also the charge that is given to Aeolus in both poems. First, from
      Homer:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Aeolus gave Odysseus a leather bag, of a nine year-old ox he&#x2019;d
      skinned, and bound the ways of the blustering winds in it
      for Cronion had made him master of the winds,
      both to start and stop the ones he wishes.<sup id="fnref:262"><a href="#fn:262" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>All Aeolus has to do in the <em>Odyssey</em> apparently is put the winds in a
      bag &#x2013; and everything is suddenly calm for Odysseus to go on his way. He
      is not the jailor of the winds as Aeolus is in the <em>Aeneid</em>; on the
      contrary, he simply controls them according to his fancy (cf. &#x1F45;&#x3BD; &#x3BA;&#x2019;
      &#x1F10;&#x3B8;&#x3AD;&#x3BB;&#x1FC3;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;, 22). Homer&#x2019;s Aeolus is thus &#x201C;an authoritarian figure who
      exercises absolute and peremptory judgment.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:263"><a href="#fn:263" class="footnote">31</a></sup> This could not be
      further from the nature of Aeolus&#x2019; task in Vergil&#x2019;s poem, as the
      following passage demonstrates:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;celsa sedet Aeolus arce
      sceptra tenens mollitque animas et temperat iras.
      ni faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum
      quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per auras;
      sed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris
      hoc metuens molemque et montis insuper altos
      imposuit, regemque dedit qui foedere certo
      et premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas. (<em>Aen</em>. 1.56-63)</p>
      
        <p>Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, as he both
      softens their spirits and checks their wraths. If he should not do
      this, they would no doubt carry away the seas and the lands and the
      vast sky in no time and sweep it all with them through the breezes.
      But fearing this would happen the all-powerful father hid them in dark
      caverns, placing a <em>moles</em> and high mountains above, and he gave them
      a king who under a fixed agreement would know how to restrain them and
      &#x2013; when given the order &#x2013; to loosen the reins.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>It is Aeolus&#x2019; job to make sure that he &#x201C;checks the wraths&#x201D; of the winds
      (<em>temperat iras</em>, 57); for if he should not, they would &#x201C;sweep away&#x201D;
      (<em>uerrant</em>, 59) everything &#x2013; sea, land, sky &#x2013; in their uncontrollable
      rage. Jupiter realizing this (in fact, &#x201C;fearing this,&#x201D; <em>hoc metuens</em>,
      61) built Aeolus&#x2019; Cave to ensure that there could be order in the
      cosmos. He then made Aeolus the &#x201C;king&#x201D; (<em>regem</em>, 62) of the winds. This
      charge is given to Aeolus not so that he can use them as he pleases, as
      he does in Homer; it is &#x201C;under a fixed agreement&#x201D; (<em>foedere certo</em>, 62)
      here that Aeolus is said to control the winds &#x201C;when given the order&#x201D;
      (<em>iussus</em>, 63), presumably, by Jupiter himself. This is not then a
      simple matter of putting the winds in a bag. The cosmic significance of
      Aeolus&#x2019; charge in the <em>Aeneid</em> signals a need for a different kind of
      architecture &#x2013; one not simply for display, or one that is intended to
      keep things out, but rather one which would contain, or &#x201C;hide&#x201D; (cf.
      <em>abdidit</em>, 60), that which would upset the established order of
      Jupiter.<sup id="fnref:264"><a href="#fn:264" class="footnote">32</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>But why speak of this cave as architectural? Aeolus&#x2019; palace in the
      <em>Aeneid</em> is a &#x201C;vast cave&#x201D; (cf. <em>vasto</em>&#x2026;<em>antro</em>, 52; <em>speluncis</em>, 60),
      after all. It is important to note, though, that it is also an
      <em>artificial</em> cave constructed by Jupiter himself: <em>molemque et montis
      insuper altos</em> / <em>imposuit</em> (61-62). In other words, this mountain is
      not natural, <em>per se</em>, but <em>imposed</em> upon nature by the king of the
      gods. The artificiality of this &#x201C;mountain&#x201D; is emphasized, moreover, by
      the poet&#x2019;s identification of it as a <em>moles</em>, that is, a large, usually
      man-made structure often built as a means to create land over a body of
      water.<sup id="fnref:265"><a href="#fn:265" class="footnote">33</a></sup> At the same time, however, this is no ordinary <em>moles</em> that
      functions merely as a dam or as a means to extend the land into the
      sea.<sup id="fnref:266"><a href="#fn:266" class="footnote">34</a></sup> The structure is meant rather to contain the chaos that
      apparently used to run rampant in a time before any order. One could
      even say that Aeolus&#x2019; Cave is the very <em>first</em> structure in the sense
      that it necessarily precedes all others: if the Aeolus should not
      restrain the winds in this <em>moles</em>, the poet warns, &#x201C;they would no doubt
      carry away the seas and the lands and the vast sky in no time and sweep
      it all with them through the breezes&#x201D; (<em>ni faciat, maria ac terras
      caelumque profundum</em> / <em>quippe ferant rapidi secum uerrantque per
      auras</em>, 1.58-59). Nothing could stand for very long, in other words,
      without this massive structure to keep the winds in check. It is
      possible, therefore, to see a double meaning in Aeolus&#x2019; statement to
      Juno that gods have made him <em>tempestatum</em>&#x2026; <em>potentem</em> (1.80), namely,
      that he is not only &#x201C;powerful over the storms,&#x201D; but over &#x201C;time&#x201D;
      itself,<sup id="fnref:267"><a href="#fn:267" class="footnote">35</a></sup> since there would be nothing &#x2013; no structures, no monuments
      &#x2013; to mark the passage of time if the winds were to roam free as
      previously in what could only be an eternal chaos.<sup id="fnref:268"><a href="#fn:268" class="footnote">36</a></sup> It is
      architecture, then, which the <em>Aeneid</em> suggests as the very craft which
      gives structure not only to space but even to time against the chaos
      which seems to be a constant in the story of Rome from the start.<sup id="fnref:269"><a href="#fn:269" class="footnote">37</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It makes a certain amount of sense that the first building to appear in
      Vergil&#x2019;s narrative would also be the primordial edifice of his epic
      cosmos.<sup id="fnref:270"><a href="#fn:270" class="footnote">38</a></sup> With such significance, however, it is important to note
      again that there is something quite unnatural about this <em>moles</em>. Aeolus
      must subdue the winds struggling to break free (<em>luctantis uentos</em>, 53)
      with his &#x201C;power&#x201D; (<em>imperio</em>, 54) and &#x2013; even more unnatural &#x2013; he must do
      so by &#x201C;restrain[ing] them in chains and a prison&#x201D; (<em>uinclis et carcere
      frenat</em>, 54) that his cave represents. Indeed, these winds are further
      described as <em>indignantes</em> at their imprisonment,<sup id="fnref:271"><a href="#fn:271" class="footnote">39</a></sup> as they &#x201C;roar at
      their locks&#x201D; (<em>circum claustra fremunt</em>, 56). This imposition of a
      structure upon a clearly unwilling element of nature is thus both
      explicitly highlighted and rather extreme &#x2013; especially when compared,
      for instance, to the mere &#x201C;bag&#x201D; that Aeolus uses to hold the winds in
      the <em>Odyssey</em>. The fact that the next part of the line after the caesura
      calls Aeolus&#x2019; residence a lofty citadel (<em>celsa</em>&#x2026;<em>arce</em>, 56) further
      illustrates that this is certainly not as natural a cave as it might
      have appeared at first.<sup id="fnref:272"><a href="#fn:272" class="footnote">40</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The above analysis of this primeval edifice thus far has highlighted two
      important points about the place of architecture in Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em>:
      [1] nature in the poem is filled with chaotic and violent forces and
      [2] the structures that try to impose order upon them are not accepted
      willingly by those forces. What is even more significant perhaps for
      this present study is the fact that this &#x201C;first&#x201D; structure eventually
      fails &#x2013; even if only temporarily &#x2013; to contain those forces: Aeolus is
      easily bribed by Juno to set free the winds and cracks open the <em>moles</em>
      imposed upon them in order to give them a breach from which to
      depart.<sup id="fnref:273"><a href="#fn:273" class="footnote">41</a></sup> This failure is particularly noteworthy because it means
      that even a structure built by the &#x201C;all-mighty&#x201D; (<em>omnipotens</em>, 60)
      Jupiter cannot keep these forces in check permanently.</p>
      
      <p>It is not simply &#x201C;violence suppressed and then coming to the surface&#x201D;
      that is the &#x201C;all-encompassing motif&#x201D; of this opening scene,<sup id="fnref:274"><a href="#fn:274" class="footnote">42</a></sup> but a
      much more primordial kind of chaos from the deep past that must be
      overcome for order to exist at all. Such cosmic order is quickly
      regained, of course, when Neptune emerges from the sea to chastise the
      winds.<sup id="fnref:275"><a href="#fn:275" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Yet the fact that the &#x201C;first&#x201D; building in the poem fails to
      accomplish the purpose for which it was built &#x2013; if only for a short
      while &#x2013; should make readers somewhat suspicious from the start of
      architecture&#x2019;s ability to maintain the stability of its imposition on
      these buried chaotic forces of the past. The below examination of other
      caves in the poem will show that the failure of such structures to hold
      in check these forces is in fact a common theme throughout the epic.</p>
      
      <p>Before I turn to those other failed structures, however, it is essential
      at this point to introduce another edifice in Book 1 that I will return
      to several times in my analysis of the epic&#x2019;s architexture. After
      discussing in very general terms the history of Rome for the sake of the
      distressed Venus, whose son Aeneas has been tossed about on the sea by
      Aeolus&#x2019; storms, the father of the gods goes into great detail to depict
      what lurks inside of the Temple of Janus in Vergil&#x2019;s own day:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;dirae ferro et compagibus artis
      claudentur Belli portae; Furor impius intus
      saeua sedens super arma et centum uinctus aenis
      post tergum nodis fremet horridus ore cruento. (<em>Aen</em>. 1.293-296)</p>
      
        <p>Those terrible gates of War will be closed with tight, iron bounds.
      Seated within upon cruel weapons and bound by a hundred bronze knots
      behind his back impious <em>Furor</em> will give a terrifying roar from his
      mouth stained with blood.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The imagery in this passage is remarkably similar in several respects to
      features of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave examined above.<sup id="fnref:276"><a href="#fn:276" class="footnote">44</a></sup> The Temple of Janus is
      also presented as a sort of prison that has been bolted shut (<em>ferro et
      compagibus artis</em> / <em>claudentur</em>, 293-294). Just like the winds,
      moreover, the main prisoner &#x2013; the personified <em>Furor</em> &#x2013; is bound with
      chains: his hands have been tied behind his back by a thousand brazen
      knots (cf. <em>centum uinctus aenis</em> / <em>post tergum nodis</em>, 295-296).
      Finally, the main verb, <em>fremet</em> (&#x201C;roars,&#x201D; 296), almost cannot but
      remind a reader of the winds who also are said to <em>fremunt</em> at their own
      bonds (<em>circum claustra</em> <em>fremunt</em>, 56) not too much earlier in Book 1.
      There is no Augustus at the core of this temple as in the proem of
      <em>Georgics</em> 3. The space in the <em>Aeneid</em> is occupied instead by a
      personification of disorder itself that though chained is definitely not
      a willing prisoner.</p>
      
      <p>In both of these scenes, then, the depiction of architecture represents
      it as a means of containing (or even hiding) a violent, chaotic force
      from the past that threatens to break down established structures and
      general order. Given the proximity in the poem of these two buildings at
      the very start of the epic, however, it does not seem inappropriate to
      question the ability of the temple to continue to keep such a force in
      check. If a cavernous <em>moles</em> built by Jupiter himself fails to contain
      this chaos permanently, who is to say that the Temple of Janus might not
      one day crack, as well? Rome might be an <em>imperium</em> <em>sine fine</em> (&#x201C;an
      empire without boundary,&#x201D; <em>Aen</em>. 1.279) when it comes to its ability to
      expand without limit. There <em>are</em> boundaries that exist within it,
      though, at its very center and which contain a force &#x2013; civil strife &#x2013;
      perhaps even more destructive than anything at its outer borders, as any
      Roman living through the decades of civil war in the 1<sup>st</sup> Century BCE
      could attest. In short, the <em>Aeneid</em> from the start configures the story
      of Rome as a constant struggle to contain a violent chaos that seeks to
      breakdown any order imposed upon it &#x2013; from Aeolus&#x2019; Cave at the very
      start of time all the way to the Temple of Janus in the Augustan age
      itself.</p>
      
      <p>The first 300 lines of the <em>Aeneid</em> present a much different
      understanding of architecture than what is found in Horace&#x2019;s <em>Odes</em>
      where his <em>monumentum</em> of a poem was able to resist indefinitely the
      storms of time that wear down all human achievement.<sup id="fnref:277"><a href="#fn:277" class="footnote">45</a></sup> In the
      <em>Aeneid</em>, on the other hand, it is the chaos <em>within</em> the structure that
      is the point of interest. Aeolus&#x2019; Cave sets the stage from the very
      start of the poem for a particular kind of architextural boundary that
      does not help one to expand what one has so much as to enclose within
      that which would threaten the stability of everything that one has
      established. The failure of this kind of architecture to contain such
      forces repeats throughout the <em>Aeneid</em> in other &#x201C;caves,&#x201D; as well as in
      the poem&#x2019;s labyrinths, and should alert the reader to the fragile nature
      of the more triumphant kind of architecture that the poem presents in
      the form of <em>monumenta</em>, particularly in Book 8. As the next chapter
      will demonstrate, in fact, the architexture of Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em> finds a
      place between these two kinds of architecture: it is at once a
      monumental facade that makes a claim to a specific, glorious meaning
      <em>and</em> a &#x201C;failed&#x201D; monument that shows the cracks in its magnificent epic
      frame, revealing the chaos of the past lurking behind it.</p>
      
      <h4 id="ii-the-trojan-horse">(ii) The Trojan Horse</h4>
      
      <p>Although the Cave of Aeolus was built by Jupiter, it ultimately fails to
      contain permanently the chaotic forces of the deep past that threaten
      the order he has established on a cosmic level. Failed attempts to
      contain such forces also occur on a smaller scale in the poem, as can be
      witnessed, for instance, in the case of the Trojan Horse. This section
      will show that the various descriptions in Book 2 of the Trojan Horse &#x2013;
      another unnatural <em>moles</em><sup id="fnref:278"><a href="#fn:278" class="footnote">46</a></sup> &#x2013; bear a striking resemblance to the way
      that the poet described Aeolus&#x2019; Cave analyzed above. There are certain
      differences between the two structures, however, and analyzing these
      will help to flesh out additional important aspects of &#x201C;failed&#x201D;
      architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em>, especially from the perspective of those
      who see only the present surface and are unmindful of the past chaos
      within.</p>
      
      <p>Let us start where Aeneas himself begins his narrative of the fall of
      Troy at the beginning of Book 2:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;fracti bello fatisque repulsi
      ductores Danaum, tot iam labentibus annis,
      instar montis equum diuina Palladis arte
      aedificant sectaque intexunt abiete costas;
      uotum pro reditu simulant: ea fama uagatur.
      huc delecta uirum sortiti corpora furtim
      includunt caeco lateri penitusque cauernas
      ingentis uterumque armato milite complent. (<em>Aen</em>. 2.13-20)</p>
      
        <p>When the commanders of the Greeks were broken by war and driven back
      by fates &#x2013; so many years having slipped by already &#x2013; they build a
      horse the equivalent of a mountain with the divine craft of Pallas
      Athena and weave its ribs from the chopped-up wood [of their ships].
      They pretend that it is an offering for their safe return: this is the
      rumor that spreads. Secretly they enclose the bodies of men selected
      by lot there in its dark flank, within its vast caverns, filling its
      womb with an armed band of soldiers.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>With nothing else left to try the Greek leaders turn to trickery in
      order to take the city of Troy. What is immediately noteworthy about
      this passage is the tension between natural and artificial &#x2013; a
      characteristic already noted above in the description of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave in
      Book 1. First of all, one usually does not &#x201C;build a horse&#x201D;
      (<em>equum</em>&#x2026;<em>aedificant</em>, 15-16), or use pieces of ships to &#x201C;weave ribs&#x201D;
      (<em>intexunt</em>&#x2026;<em>costas</em>, 16).<sup id="fnref:279"><a href="#fn:279" class="footnote">47</a></sup> There is again something unnatural
      about this construction for the Greeks who are doing it all with the
      help of another god, that is, &#x201C;with the divine craft of Pallas Athena&#x201D;
      (<em>divina Palladis arte</em>, 15).<sup id="fnref:280"><a href="#fn:280" class="footnote">48</a></sup> And it is not just that they are
      building a horse; more than that, they are raising it to be &#x201C;the
      equivalent of a mountain&#x201D; (<em>instar montis</em>, 15), rivaling the natural
      with their artificial construction. The Horse is not merely as big as a
      mountain, though. Just as with the <em>moles</em> that Jupiter constructs to
      house the winds the Trojan Horse is also said to contain a violent force
      &#x201C;within its vast caverns&#x201D; (<em>penitus</em>&#x2026;<em>cavernas</em> / <em>ingentis</em>,
      19-20),<sup id="fnref:281"><a href="#fn:281" class="footnote">49</a></sup> namely, the Greeks who &#x201C;fill its womb with an armed band
      of soldiers&#x201D; (<em>uterumque armato milite complent</em>, 20).<sup id="fnref:282"><a href="#fn:282" class="footnote">50</a></sup> This idea
      that the Greeks have somehow &#x201C;impregnated&#x201D; the Horse calls to mind the
      very first detail the reader learns about Aeolus&#x2019; land: it too is
      &#x201C;pregnant with winds&#x201D; (cf. <em>feta uentis</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.51) &#x2013; furious winds
      that Jupiter has implanted within his artificial construction. The
      Greeks not only &#x201C;build&#x201D; (<em>aedificant</em>, 16) a horse, then, but construct
      it as a <em>moles</em> to rival even a mountain together with the dark caves it
      might contain. Both of these ideas suggest an overstepping of what is
      natural for one to construct. But the poet goes a step further by
      implying that the Greeks even impregnate it (cf. <em>uterumque</em>&#x2026;
      <em>complent</em>, 20), too, with men ready to destroy the city of Troy.<sup id="fnref:283"><a href="#fn:283" class="footnote">51</a></sup>
      The poet makes it explicit in several way therefore that the Trojan
      Horse from its very first description is represented like Aeolus&#x2019; Cave
      as an artificial construction that contains violent, destructive forces
      of the past which seek to destroy all order &#x2013; in this case, the Greeks
      with their desire to overturn the order of Trojan life and the city that
      contains it.</p>
      
      <p>It is not just the similarity to the description of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave that
      brings the Trojan Horse in dialogue with the chaotic scene from Book 1
      examined in the previous section; more importantly, the ultimate
      &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of the Trojan Horse to contain its own chaotic forces likewise
      calls to mind the unleashing of the winds by Aeolus. When the Greeks
      slip out of the Horse at night they too introduce a chaotic force that
      will end up destroying all order and bringing about the city&#x2019;s literal
      downfall.<sup id="fnref:284"><a href="#fn:284" class="footnote">52</a></sup> The close connection between these two destructive,
      chaotic forces &#x2013; the winds of Aeolus and the Greeks in the Horse &#x2013; is in
      fact anticipated by the language which the poet uses at the very start
      of this process. When Aeneas awakes from his dream featuring Hector&#x2019;s
      ghost, the Trojan hero goes outside and describes the chaos he beholds
      with the following simile:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>in segetem ueluti cum flamma <strong>furentibus Austris</strong>
      incidit, aut rapidus montano flumine torrens
      sternit agros, sternit sata laeta boumque labores
      praecipitesque trahit siluas&#x2026; (<em>Aen</em>. 2.304-307)</p>
      
        <p>Just as when fire falls upon the grain field <strong>with raging southwest
      winds</strong>, or the swift torrent from a mountain river covers the fields,
      covers the bountiful harvests, and drags along with it the toils of
      bulls and falling trees.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The most pertinent part of this frightening simile is the end of the
      first line: &#x201C;with raging southwest winds&#x201D; (<em>furentibus Austris</em>, 304).
      The only other time that Vergil uses this particular phrase &#x2013; and in the
      exact same position in the meter no less &#x2013; is when the poet describes
      Aeolus&#x2019; Cave examined above, where the king&#x2019;s land is also said to be
      filled with <em>furentibus Austris</em> (1.51).<sup id="fnref:285"><a href="#fn:285" class="footnote">53</a></sup> It is not a coincidence
      that the men who come from the horse are compared to the furious winds
      so precisely: the poet is foreshadowing through this simile the parallel
      nature of these forces of violence from the past that break free of
      their bounds to wreak havoc on the established order of things &#x2013; whether
      it be in the middle of the sea, or inside the stable, long-standing city
      of Troy.</p>
      
      <p>There are also two important differences, however, between Aeolus&#x2019;s Cave
      and the Trojan Horse that complicate the theme of &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architecture
      in the <em>Aeneid</em>. First, the primary purpose for the construction of the
      former structure is to prevent the chaos it is holding from destroying
      all order &#x2013; something the <em>moles</em> fails to accomplish temporarily at
      least when Aeolus releases the winds. In the case of the Horse, however,
      there are different motivations for such a construction: the Greeks
      build it in order to hold a destructive force that will eventually
      destroy the solid citadel of Troy when unleashed. In other words, the
      monumental horse is a case of an intentionally failed piece of
      architecture, that is, an edifice designed to &#x201C;crack&#x201D; and release the
      chaos from the past that it contains.</p>
      
      <p>This does not mean, though, that the purpose of the Horse is apparent to
      all. And the ambiguity of its meaning suggests a second important
      difference between the two artificial <em>moles</em>. Aeolus&#x2019; Cave seems to be
      far away from the realm of mortals in the middle of the sea; its
      external appearance &#x2013; be it an immense mountain &#x2013; is not too important.
      The Trojan Horse is an explicitly monumental structure, on the other
      hand, one meant to elicit the awe of those who see it. The purpose of
      its construction is to create a facade that allows the structure to
      express another meaning than the one for which it was actually built. It
      will be easiest perhaps to see this ambiguity of meaning which exists
      between what one sees on the surface and what lies beneath by examining
      the different ways that the Trojan priest Laocoon and the Greek
      &#x201C;runaway&#x201D; Sinon craft their respective arguments regarding the Horse&#x2019;s
      meaning, as well as the relative success of each.</p>
      
      <p>The priest of Neptune makes several remarks that encourage his fellow
      Trojans to look past the magnificent exterior of the Horse:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;&#x201C;o miseri, quae tanta insania, ciues?
      creditis auectos hostis? aut ulla putatis
      dona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Vlixes?
      aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achiui,
      aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros
      inspectura domos uenturaque desuper urbi,
      aut aliquis latet error: equo ne credite, Teucri.
      quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.&#x201D; (<em>Aen</em>. 2.42-49)</p>
      
        <p>&#x201C;My misfortunate fellow citizens, what so great madness is this? Do
      you believe the enemy has sailed away? Or do you think that any gifts
      of the Greeks are without tricks? Is that the Ulysses we know? Either
      the Achaeans are hidden closed within this wood, or this war-machine
      has been constructed against our walls so that it can inspect our
      homes and come into our city from above, or some <em>error</em> lies hidden:
      do not believe in this horse, Trojans. Whatever it is, I fear even
      Greeks bearing gifts.&#x201D;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>For Laocoon, at least, this structure is no doubt hiding Greek &#x201C;tricks&#x201D;
      (<em>dolis Danaum</em>, 44) and/or Greeks themselves (cf. <em>occultantur Achiui</em>,
      45). It is a structure, moreover, that Laoccon claims has been
      &#x201C;constructed against [Troy&#x2019;s] walls&#x201D; (<em>in&#x2026;fabricata est</em>&#x2026;<em>muros</em>,
      46): it will not only look over the city, but the very homes (<em>domos</em>,
      47) of its inhabitants &#x2013; bypassing the distinction between private and
      public in the urban realm. What it contains Laocoon himself does not
      know (<em>quidquid id est</em>, 49) &#x2013; only that some <em>error</em>, some devious,
      unexpected outcome lies hidden (<em>aliquis latet error</em>, 48).<sup id="fnref:286"><a href="#fn:286" class="footnote">54</a></sup> This
      is no ordinary &#x201C;horse.&#x201D; And the priest is right to urge his citizens not
      to put their faith in it (<em>equo ne credite, Teucri</em>, 49).</p>
      
      <p>The interpretation that Laocoon presents might be correct: he is
      certainly right, after all, to try to reveal the sinister contents that
      the monumental facade hides. That does him little good, though, as he
      cannot pierce the exterior to the truth underneath:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>sic fatus ualidis ingentem uiribus hastam
      in latus inque feri curuam compagibus aluum
      contorsit. stetit illa tremens, uteroque recusso
      insonuere cauae gemitumque dedere cauernae (<em>Aen</em>. 2.50-53)</p>
      
        <p>When he had said this [Laocoon] hurled his great spear with mighty
      strength into the side of the beast, into the belly round with joints.
      The spear stood there trembling, and at the strike of the womb the
      hollow caverns echoed and let go a groan.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In this passage, too, the reader can see again not only the suggestion
      that the &#x201C;beast&#x201D; is in some way pregnant (<em>curuum</em>&#x2026;<em>aluum</em>, 51;
      <em>uteroque recusso</em>, 52), but also the image of the Horse as a kind of
      cave: the &#x201C;hollow caverns&#x201D; (<em>cavae</em>&#x2026;<em>cavernae</em>, 53) resound and give a
      groan when struck by the priest&#x2019;s weapon. Laocoon&#x2019;s actions might even
      remind the reader of the way that Aeolus used his spear to release the
      winds and set them about on their rampage: as the king of the winds is
      said to have struck the mountain with his spear (<em>cauum conuersa cuspide
      montem</em> / <em>impulit in latus</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.81-82), Laocoon also strikes into
      the side of the horse (<em>in latus</em>, 51) with his spear (<em>hastam</em>, 50).
      Yet even if he is able to hit the structure, the priest is unable to
      reveal what lies beneath its surface within the Horse&#x2019;s artificially
      constructed cavern.<sup id="fnref:287"><a href="#fn:287" class="footnote">55</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Laocoon is not the builder of the Horse. Unlike Aeolus, moreover, the
      Trojan priest is not the owner of the &#x201C;beast,&#x201D; either. It is as a mere
      spectator that Laocoon fails in his attempt to display the <em>error</em> that
      lies hidden within the facade. His inability to reveal the hidden
      meaning of the structure is not insignificant, however, when compared to
      the much different outcome that the Greek &#x201C;runaway&#x201D; Sinon encounters
      upon his explanation of the Horse&#x2019;s meaning. Sinon is in fact much more
      successful in the way that he determines the meaning of the Horse and
      its monumental size for its Trojan onlookers. And it is important for
      the discussion of Vergilian <em>monumenta</em> below in the following chapter
      to consider the reasons for Sinon&#x2019;s success in contrast to the failure
      of Laocoon to control the meaning of the structure.</p>
      
      <p>Below is what the crafty Greek claims in response to Priam&#x2019;s question as
      to why this <em>moles</em> of a Horse was built in the first place:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hanc pro Palladia moniti, pro numine laesa
      effigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.
      hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem
      roboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,
      ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset
      neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri. (<em>Aen</em>. 2.183-188)</p>
      
        <p>They constructed this effigy at [Calchus&#x2019;] warning on behalf of the
      Palladium, for the sake of the wounded divine will, so that it could
      atone for their grim crime. Yet Calchus ordered them to erect this
      immense <em>moles</em> of woven oak and build it to the sky, in order that it
      could not be received by your gates or led into your walls, and so
      that it could not watch over your people in the course of their
      ancient religious rites.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>It was the Greek prophet Calchas, according to Sinon, who ordered the
      Greeks to &#x201C;erect this immense <em>moles</em>&#x201D; (<em>hanc&#x2026;immmensam&#x2026;attollere
      molem</em>, 185) in order to atone for stealing the Palladium from Troy. The
      sly Greek makes it look like a regular (albeit massive) offering: he
      uses none of the language that seeks to blur the distinction between
      natural and artificial &#x2013; not even calling the structure a &#x201C;horse&#x201D; at any
      point. He focuses on the grand exterior, explaining that structure was
      built so big that it would be able neither to be led into gates and
      walls of a city (cf. <em>ne recipi portis aut duci in moenia posset</em>, 187)
      nor to be worshipped under the Trojans&#x2019; traditional religion (cf. <em>neu
      populurn antiqua sub religione tueri</em>, 188).<sup id="fnref:288"><a href="#fn:288" class="footnote">56</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>By focusing on the exterior Sinon succeeds where Laocoon failed in
      persuading his fellow onlookers of the meaning of the monumental
      <em>moles</em>.<sup id="fnref:289"><a href="#fn:289" class="footnote">57</a></sup> And the inclusion of the Horse in the city despite
      Sinon&#x2019;s rhetorical &#x201C;warnings&#x201D; is significant for illustrating the
      effects that grand facades can have on their spectators. The Trojans are
      completely unaware of the import of what they are doing and refuse to
      see the clear signs of trouble: for instance, when the Horse halts four
      times on the threshold and the weapons that it contains rattle, the
      inhabitants of the city seem oblivious (<em>immemores</em>) to the sounds that
      the beast makes and instead &#x201C;blinded with fury&#x201D; (<em>caeci</em>&#x2026;<em>furore</em>)
      place the <em>monstrum</em> in the center of the city (cf. <em>Aen</em>.
      2.240-243).<sup id="fnref:290"><a href="#fn:290" class="footnote">58</a></sup> Again, it is important for the discussion below in
      Chapter V to stress here the effects that this kind of monumental
      architecture can have on people &#x2013; that is, to make them <em>immemores</em> of,
      or <em>caeci</em> to, what could lie behind a grand facade, or what monsters of
      one&#x2019;s past a monumental structure could contain.</p>
      
      <p>The Trojan Horse therefore demonstrates another important element of the
      failed structures in the poem, namely, the way that a monumental
      exterior can make those who behold a massive <em>moles</em> unmindful of what
      fury of the past it could be concealing. The need for a critical
      approach to reading beneath the surface of such structures is suggested
      not only by Laocoon&#x2019;s inability to persuade his fellow Trojans to look
      beyond the awesome facade of the Horse; more than that, it is the
      relative ease with which Sinon tricks the Trojans by focusing their
      attention on the Horse&#x2019;s extraordinary frame that makes an ability to
      read beneath the surface so critical. The Trojans are blinded by the
      monumental facade of the horse &#x2013; and it costs them dearly. The poet&#x2019;s
      narrative of the Trojan Horse is thus similar to his account of Cacus&#x2019;
      cave in the way that it too should make one suspicious of architecture&#x2019;s
      ability to contain the chaos inherent to the past in the Vergil&#x2019;s story
      of Rome. The poet&#x2019;s telling of Troy&#x2019;s downfall warns his readers at the
      same time to be suspicious of monumental structures, in particular,
      especially those whose splendid exteriors can make one forgetful of the
      chaos that might lie below their marvelous surfaces.</p>
      
      <p>The close parallel of the Horse&#x2019;s imagery with that of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave in
      the previous book of the poem should again make the reader consider
      whether it is wise (or even possible) to hold at bay the forces of chaos
      from the past that these cavernous <em>moles</em> contain. Is the Temple of
      Janus &#x2013; a structure placed at the center of Rome as the Horse was at
      Troy &#x2013; another construction that could eventually fail and let loose
      again the violent chaos of Rome&#x2019;s past? The Trojan Horse and the Cave of
      Aeolus do not offer the epic&#x2019;s readers much confidence in architecture&#x2019;s
      ability to contain such a force; if anything, in fact, they demonstrate
      vividly the disaster which the release of such a force can wreak,
      whether on a city or the world at large.</p>
      
      <h4 id="iii-cacus-cave">(iii) Cacus&#x2019; Cave</h4>
      
      <p>In Book 8 of the poem Aeneas sees the site that eventually will become
      Rome. And even at that time in the distant past there are <em>monumenta</em>
      there. Evander is Aeneas&#x2019; guide and reveals to him &#x201C;the remains and
      monuments of the men of old&#x201D; (<em>reliquias ueterumque&#x2026;monumenta
      uirorum</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 8.356, cf. 8.312). The next chapter will examine
      exactly what such <em>monumenta</em> might mean to Evander, to Aeneas, and to
      the contemporary Roman reader. It is necessary first, however, to look
      at another important constructed cave that appears in this book of the
      poem, namely, the Cave of Cacus. This cave also contains an evil,
      chaotic force that existed in Rome&#x2019;s distant past &#x2013; on the very site of
      Rome no less &#x2013; in ways not dissimilar to Aeolus&#x2019; Cave and the Trojan
      Horse examined above. The crucial difference with the failure of this
      final cavernous <em>moles</em> is the way that the destructive force within can
      also affect those who actively break open the structure to engage with
      it &#x2013; even in the attempt to rid the world of such a chaos permanently.</p>
      
      <p>The Trojans sail on the Tiber to the Greek colony of Pallanteum and are
      received hospitably at a feast in which the dislocated Greeks under
      Evander are participating. After both peoples have taken in such
      festivities Evander tells Aeneas what exactly it is that they are
      celebrating: it is not some &#x201C;empty superstition&#x201D; (<em>uana superstitio</em>,
      <em>Aen</em>. 8.187) that established the ritual, he informs his Trojan guest,
      but rather the fact that his people were &#x201C;saved from severe dangers&#x201D;
      (<em>saevis&#x2026;periclis</em> / <em>seruati</em>, 8.188-189). The Greek king then goes
      on to relate the story of how Hercules rescued them all from Cacus, a
      fire-breathing monster that had terrorized the region until the
      demigod&#x2019;s arrival &#x2013; all while pointing to the very place where the
      violent struggle happened. The following lines are the beginning of his
      description:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>iam primum saxis suspensam hanc aspice rupem,
      disiectae procul ut moles desertaque montis
      stat domus et scopuli ingentem traxere ruinam.
      hic spelunca fuit uasto summota recessu,
      semihominis Caci facies quam dira tenebat
      solis inaccessam radiis; semperque recenti
      caede tepebat humus, foribusque adfixa superbis
      ora uirum tristi pendebant pallida tabo.
      huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros
      ore uomens ignis magna se mole ferebat. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.190-199)</p>
      
        <p>Now first take a look at this cliff, rocky and overhanging, how
      <em>moles</em> have been scattered far and wide, how a deserted mountain home
      stands there, and how the boulders have drawn done a mighty collapse.
      Here set back in a vast recess was the cave that the terrible
      appearance of the half-man Cacus was possessing &#x2013; a cave inaccessible
      to the rays of the sun. Always the ground was warm with recent
      slaughter, always fastened to his haughty doors were dangling the
      heads of men pale with grim gore. Vulcan was this monster&#x2019;s father: it
      was <em>his</em> black fires that Cacus would vomit from his mouth while he
      was bearing the great mass of himself.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Here again is a &#x201C;cave&#x201D; (<em>spelunca</em>, 193).<sup id="fnref:291"><a href="#fn:291" class="footnote">59</a></sup> And once again it does
      not seem to be entirely natural. It has been &#x201C;set back in a vast recess&#x201D;
      from the mountain, Evander tells Aeneas, made into a &#x201C;home&#x201D; (<em>domus</em>)
      for Cacus (192-193). It is indeed another <em>moles</em> &#x2013; albeit one that has
      been destroyed already (cf. <em>disiectae&#x2026;moles</em>, 191) and is now lying
      in ruin. Vulcan is the father of this &#x201C;half-human&#x201D; (<em>semihominis</em>, 194),
      massive, fire-vomiting &#x201C;monster&#x201D; (<em>monstro</em>, 198). As the reader learns
      a little later, moreover, it was by the fire god&#x2019;s own craftsmanship
      (<em>arte paterna</em>, 8.226) that the &#x201C;cave&#x201D; has a means of closing.<sup id="fnref:292"><a href="#fn:292" class="footnote">60</a></sup>
      Although it might then appear initially like a natural phenomenon,
      Cacus&#x2019; Cave is thus similar to the other &#x201C;caves&#x201D; examined above: it too
      serves as a constructed object that hides a force of pure destruction &#x2013;
      of evil itself, in fact, as the monster&#x2019;s name implies<sup id="fnref:293"><a href="#fn:293" class="footnote">61</a></sup> &#x2013; which
      stands in the way of civilization and the attempt to establish
      order.<sup id="fnref:294"><a href="#fn:294" class="footnote">62</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>There is an important difference between this cavernous <em>moles</em> and the
      previous ones, however. Although Aeolus is not the builder of his cave,
      the king of the winds is in control of the chaos that lives within his
      cave &#x2013; and he opens it under his own will. With the Trojan Horse,
      moreover, the Greeks who constructed it are the ones that break the seal
      and wreak their havoc upon the city (though Laocoon tried his best to
      reveal the <em>error</em> that lurked within the beast). In the case of Cacus&#x2019;
      Cave, on the other hand, the evil is <em>unwillingly</em> exposed by Hercules,
      who not only breaks open the <em>moles</em> (and breaks it apart), but also
      enters it in order to confront the destructive force that lies hidden
      within.</p>
      
      <p>There are significant similarities, as one might expect, between how
      Hercules opens the cave and the way that both Aeolus breaks open his own
      one in Book 1 and Laocoon attempts to pierce the ones in Trojan Horse in
      Book 2, as the following passage makes clear:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hanc, ut prona iugo laeuum incumbebat ad amnem,
      dexter in aduersum nitens concussit et imis
      auulsam soluit radicibus, <strong>inde repente **
      **impulit; impulsu quo maximus intonat aether</strong>
      <strong>dissultant ripae refluitque exterritus amnis</strong>. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.236-240)</p>
      
        <p>Once [Hercules] had shaken this [stone] with all his effort from
      the right side, as it lay sloping along its ridge to the river on the
      left, and loosened it having ripped it up from its lowermost roots,
      <strong>he then suddenly struck it. The upper air thunders loudly at such a
      blow, the riverbanks jump back, and the river terrified reverses its
      course</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Hercules through his great strength removes a giant stone so that he can
      gain access to the top of the cave in which Cacus has hid himself. In
      order to accomplish this, he had to &#x201C;strike&#x201D; (cf. <em>impulit</em>, 239) it
      with all his force &#x2013; a strike that makes the upper air thunder and
      causes the river itself to reverse its course.<sup id="fnref:295"><a href="#fn:295" class="footnote">63</a></sup> It is significant
      that <em>impulit</em> is enjambed in the same position at the beginning of the
      line as when Vergil narrates how Aeolus &#x201C;struck&#x201D; his cave (cf. <em>Aen</em>.
      1.81-82). That is not the only similarity, though, which links the two
      events: both strikes result in thunderstorms (cf. <em>Aen</em>. 1.81-91); more
      than that, the blow is so great that it too disrupts the established
      order of things in making the river reverse its course (<em>refluitque
      exterritus amnis</em>, 240) &#x2013; just as the winds had made what was on the
      bottom of the sea suddenly rise to the top.<sup id="fnref:296"><a href="#fn:296" class="footnote">64</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Hercules thus opens the cave as Aeolus does and thereby succeeds where
      Laocoon failed. Yet there is still a price he must pay for breaking open
      this divinely-built structure and unleashing the chaotic forces within.
      Something happens to the hero upon his entry into the primordial chaos
      that the cave seeks to contain and hide: Hercules becomes very much like
      the monster that he is trying to vanquish.<sup id="fnref:297"><a href="#fn:297" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Cacus&#x2019; Cave is a dark
      place &#x2013; not only because the rays of the sun cannot access it (cf.
      <em>solis inaccessam radiis</em>, 8.195), but also because of the &#x201C;black fires&#x201D;
      (<em>atros</em>&#x2026;<em>ignis</em>, 8.199-200) which Cacus vomits from his mouth.<sup id="fnref:298"><a href="#fn:298" class="footnote">66</a></sup>
      And this darkness seems to envelop and penetrate Hercules himself as he
      fights against the monster in his lair:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>ille autem, neque enim fuga iam super ulla pericli,
      faucibus ingentem fumum (mirabile dictu)
      euomit inuoluitque domum caligine caeca
      prospectum eripiens oculis, glomeratque sub antra
      fumiferam noctem commixtis igne tenebris.
      non tulit Alcides animis seque ipse per ignem
      praecipiti iecit saltu, qua plurimus undam
      fumus agit nebulaque ingens specus aestuat atra. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.251-258)</p>
      
        <p>[Cacus], on the other hand, since there was now no more escape from
      danger, vomits forth a great cloud of smoke from his jaws (marvelous
      to say) and envelops his home with a blinding darkness, snatching
      sight from [Hercules&#x2019;] eyes. He gathers in his cave a smoke-filled
      night with shadows mixed together with flame. Hercules did not endure
      this in his spirit and threw himself with a headlong jump through the
      fire, where the thickest smoke came in waves and the vast cavern
      seethed in a black cloud.</p>

      <p>The fire which Cacus &#x201C;vomits forth&#x201D; (<em>evomit</em>, 253) envelops the cave in
      a &#x201C;blinding darkness&#x201D; (<em>caligne caeca</em>, 253). Much as the winds in Book
      1 which snatch away the sight from the eyes of the Trojans and bring
      about an untimely night (cf. <em>Aen</em>. 1.88-89), Cacus also takes the sight
      from Hercules&#x2019; eyes (<em>prospectum eripiens oculis</em>, 254) and manifests in
      his cave a &#x201C;smoke-filled night&#x201D; (<em>fumiferam noctem</em>, 255). None of this
      darkness deters Hercules, however, as the hero throws himself with a
      &#x201C;headlong jump&#x201D; (<em>preaecipiti</em>&#x2026;<em>saltu</em>, 257) right into the middle of
      the flames and the shadows. Heroic as these actions may be, Vergil&#x2019;s
      description (via Evander) of what happens next suggests that Hercules
      has lost control of himself as a result of his rage:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hic Cacum in tenebris incendia uana uomentem
      corripit in nodum complexus et angit inhaerens
      elisos ocules et siccum sanguine guttur.</p>
      
        <p>[&#x2026;]</p>
      
        <p>&#x2026;pedibusque informe cadauer
      protrahitur. nequeunt expleri corda tuendo
      terribilis oculos, uultum uillosaque saetis
      pectora semiferi atque exstinctos faucibus ignis. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.259-261,
      264-267)</p>
      
        <p>Wrapping him into a knot [Hercules] seizes Cacus vomiting vain fires
      in the shadows and gripping him tight he chokes him until his eyes
      popped out and his throat is dry with blood. [&#x2026;] The hideous
      cadaver is dragged out by the feet. Our hearts cannot get enough of
      seeing the terrible eyes of the beast, his face, his chest shaggy with
      hairs, and the fires from his jaws extinguished.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Although Cacus is a horrible monster, of course, and one that has
      terrorized humankind for many years (and has stolen Hercules&#x2019;
      cattle),<sup id="fnref:299"><a href="#fn:299" class="footnote">67</a></sup> the way that the hero kills the beast in this passage is
      rather gruesome, perhaps even excessive, as he strangles the half-human
      being to the point that Cacus&#x2019; eyes pop out (<em>angit&#x2026;elisos ocules</em>,
      260-261).<sup id="fnref:300"><a href="#fn:300" class="footnote">68</a></sup> Moreover, even while Evander and his people derive a
      twisted sort of pleasure from seeing Cacus&#x2019; dead body, the detail that
      Vergil gives to the scene &#x2013; with the corpse being dragged out by his
      feet to be gawked at by the onlookers &#x2013; has almost a twinge of sympathy.
      The poet had shown such sympathy before, after all, for another
      &#x201C;monster&#x201D; (<em>monstrum</em>, 3.658) back in Book 3: the blinded Polyphemus who
      can himself be seen as a model for Cacus with his own barbaric behavior
      in Book 9 of Homer&#x2019;s <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
      
      <p>This fire-breathing monster has been brought low. But at what cost? It
      is not too much to suggest &#x2013; as several scholars have &#x2013; that when the
      hero enters the darkness of the cave he loses control of himself and a
      sense of his own humanity.<sup id="fnref:301"><a href="#fn:301" class="footnote">69</a></sup> He would not be the first one in the
      poem to do this: Aeneas also enters a <em>spelunca</em> in book 4 and forgets
      himself and his mission, becoming <em>immemores</em> together with Dido.<sup id="fnref:302"><a href="#fn:302" class="footnote">70</a></sup>
      And the chaos that is unleashed from Aeolus&#x2019; <em>antrum</em> and the &#x201C;caverns&#x201D;
      within the Trojan Horse when they are opened should not be forgotten,
      either. Caves in the <em>Aeneid</em> represent a place where darkness and chaos
      dominate &#x2013; a place where the repressed forces of chaos that overturn any
      attempt to establish order can find a &#x201C;home&#x201D; (<em>domus</em>, 8.192). When a
      hero enters such a cave (or tries to in the case of Laocoon) these
      forces are unleashed upon him &#x2013; ending either with his destruction, as
      with Laocoon, or the breakdown of his very humanity, as seems to happen
      even to the heroic son of Jove.</p>
      
      <p>Cacus&#x2019; Cave is thus another case of &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architecture in the poem.
      Unlike in the previous two examples, however, it is not so much because
      the chaos inside breaks out. In the episode in Book 8 it is rather
      because the dark chaos of Rome&#x2019;s past surrounds and temporarily traps
      the one who breaks open the structure in the attempt to destroy it. The
      result is a hero who becomes a monster while inside the construction &#x2013;
      even if momentarily and for seemingly justifiable reasons. Even when one
      attempts to rid the world of these forces, in other words, it comes at a
      price, and with no certainty of any sort of lasting success.</p>
      
      <p>Hercules is perhaps not the only &#x201C;hero&#x201D; to undergo such a transformation
      in Book 8, however. The Cave of Cacus is built by his divine father
      Vulcan, but it is not the only (or the most famous) work of the divine
      craftsman in this book of the poem. The fire god also makes Aeneas&#x2019;
      shield which is described at length by the poet towards the end of
      <em>Aeneid</em> 8.<sup id="fnref:303"><a href="#fn:303" class="footnote">71</a></sup> This shield tells a version of Roman history through
      the pictures on its surface, with one such image depicting Augustus
      himself:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hinc Augustus agens Italos in proelia Caesar
      cum patribus populoque, penatibus et magnis dis,
      stans celsa in puppi, geminas cui tempora flammas
      laeta uomunt patriumque aperitur uertice sidus. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.680-683)</p>
      
        <p>From this side Augustus Caesar leading Italians into battle together
      with the senate and the people, together with the household gods and
      the great gods, standing on his high ship, the sides of his head
      bounteously vomiting twin flames, and his father&#x2019;s star appears on his
      top.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Augustus is depicted here as &#x201C;vomiting&#x201D; flames from the sides of his
      head (cf. <em>tempora flamma</em>&#x2026;<em>vomunt</em>, 862-863).<sup id="fnref:304"><a href="#fn:304" class="footnote">72</a></sup> A reader might be
      reminded here of another figure in the book whose actions are also
      described with the verb <em>vomere</em>, namely, Cacus himself who is said to
      be doing so three separate times: <em>vomens</em> at 8.199, <em>evomit</em> at 8.253,
      and <em>vomentem</em> at 8.259.<sup id="fnref:305"><a href="#fn:305" class="footnote">73</a></sup> This section has demonstrated that
      Hercules becomes like the monster that he kills &#x2013; even if it was to the
      benefit of the people of the proto-Rome &#x2013; as he too &#x201C;blazed with furies&#x201D;
      (<em>furiis exarserat</em>, 219) in his battle with Cacus. Augustus has tamed
      his own monstrous <em>Furor</em>, namely, the one which dwells inside the
      Temple of Janus in Book 1. What did it cost him to confront and subdue
      this monster? What structures of Rome&#x2019;s past did he have to destroy in
      that battle? And what does it do to those who try to tame the darkness
      and violence that disrupt any attempt to establish (or re-establish)
      order? Those are some of the questions that the episode surrounding
      Cacus&#x2019; Cave raises for anyone &#x2013; whether a god or a man, whether an
      Aeneas or an Augustus &#x2013; who tries to subjugate the destructive and
      violent chaos of Rome&#x2019;s story that is bound only temporarily within the
      poem&#x2019;s constructed caves.</p>
      
      <p>The three &#x201C;caves&#x201D; examined above present us with one type of &#x201C;failed&#x201D;
      architecture that attempts to impose structure on the chaotic forces of
      the past in Vergil&#x2019;s poem. These <em>moles</em> are revealed to be unstable
      constructions: their boundaries fail to contain the chaotic fury of
      Rome&#x2019;s past &#x2013; a violent force that can upset the ordered structures of
      the cosmos, of the city, and even of one&#x2019;s own humanity. The labyrinths
      in the poem represent another set of structures that attempt to contain
      and conceal such forces. In a similar way to the caves in the <em>Aeneid</em>,
      however, it is their &#x201C;failure&#x201D; to keep this chaos of the past at bay
      which the poem demonstrates for its readers.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-2-labyrinths-of-meaning">Part 2. Labyrinths of Meaning</h3>
      
      <p>As difficult as it might be to escape from labyrinths &#x2013; to find that one
      &#x201C;right&#x201D; way out &#x2013; it is similarly no easy task to understand their
      symbolic value. Penelope Doob in her wide-ranging study on the idea of
      the labyrinth in Western literature speaks of a constant &#x201C;double
      perspective&#x201D; that one must consider when one is attempting to comprehend
      the meaning of these structures. Labyrinths are incredible feats of
      humankind &#x2013; architectural masterpieces that elicited awe from those who
      saw or even read about them in antiquity.<sup id="fnref:306"><a href="#fn:306" class="footnote">74</a></sup> At the same time,
      however, labyrinths are also buildings that seem to lack a solid
      structure and organization to anyone who must enter and eventually
      escape them.<sup id="fnref:307"><a href="#fn:307" class="footnote">75</a></sup> As Doob puts it,</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>[w]hat you see depends on where you stand, and thus, at one and the
      same time, labyrinths are single (there is one physical structure) and
      double: they simultaneously incorporate order and disorder, clarity
      and confusion, unity and multiplicity, artistry and chaos.<sup id="fnref:308"><a href="#fn:308" class="footnote">76</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>For many modern (and post-modern) authors and architects, it is the
      latter of these two perspectives that has made the labyrinth a perfect
      symbol for their own struggles with meaning and language.<sup id="fnref:309"><a href="#fn:309" class="footnote">77</a></sup> Walter
      Benjamin thought of &#x201C;the modern experience&#x201D; as &#x201C;labyrinthine.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:310"><a href="#fn:310" class="footnote">78</a></sup> And
      the architectural writer Carl Jencks defined as &#x201C;Post-Modern&#x201D; any space
      that &#x201C;suspends the clear, final ordering of events for a labyrinthine,
      rambling &#x2018;way&#x2019; that never reaches an absolute goal.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:311"><a href="#fn:311" class="footnote">79</a></sup> For the
      semiotician Umberto Eco, moreover, &#x201C;the universe of semiosis can be
      postulated in the format of a labyrinth.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:312"><a href="#fn:312" class="footnote">80</a></sup> It is not, then, that
      labyrinths have no meaning or structure; it is rather that they might
      have too many meanings within a seemingly shifting structure. One might
      even go so far as Roland Barthes in discussing another great monument &#x2013;
      the Eiffel Tower &#x2013; to say that the labyrinth is similarly &#x201C;impossible to
      escape, <em>because it means everything</em>.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:313"><a href="#fn:313" class="footnote">81</a></sup> Labyrinths are thus at
      once architectural wonders <em>and</em> structures that seem to defy the very
      idea of a stable architecture.<sup id="fnref:314"><a href="#fn:314" class="footnote">82</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This double nature of architecture should already be somewhat familiar
      from the cavernous <em>moles</em> of the <em>Aeneid</em> examined in the previous part
      of this chapter. The labyrinths of the poem are likewise shown to
      present something on the surface that seems very stable and/or that
      delights while also &#x201C;cracking open&#x201D; to reveal darker, violent forces
      from the past that lie hidden beneath. With the labyrinth, however,
      there is a transition from the literal breakdown of boundaries to a more
      metaphorical collapse of the frame that allows the chaotic forces to
      escape. Although the figure of the labyrinth is a motif that has been
      demonstrated by scholars to run throughout the <em>Aeneid</em>,<sup id="fnref:315"><a href="#fn:315" class="footnote">83</a></sup> the focus
      of this section will be on the two times such structures are explicitly
      mentioned in close proximity, that is, near the end of Book 5 during the
      <em>Lusus Troiae</em> and at the beginning of Book 6 in the ecphrasis of
      Daedalus&#x2019; doors. In both instances, I argue below, these structures
      amaze their spectators and yet are instable and ultimately fail to
      contain the chaos of the past that they are built to conceal.</p>
      
      <h4 id="i-the-labyrinthine-lusus-troiae">(i) The Labyrinthine <em>Lusus Troiae</em></h4>
      
      <p>The first time that the poet mentions a labyrinth explicitly occurs in a
      simile comparing the mythical edifice to the intricate twists and turns
      of the mock-battle between the Trojan youths known as the <em>Lusus
      Troiae</em>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>ut quondam Creta fertur Labyrinthus in alta
      parietibus textum caecis iter ancipitemque
      mille uiis habuisse dolum, qua signa sequendi
      frangeret indeprensus et inremeabilis error:
      haud alio Teucrum nati uestigia cursu
      impediunt texuntque fugas et proelia ludo&#x2026; (<em>Aen</em>. 5.589-594)</p>
      
        <p>As it is said that the labyrinth on high Crete once possessed a path
      woven amid blinding walls and a trick deceptive with its thousand
      turns, where <em>error</em> that was untraceable and unsolvable would break
      the signs to follow: in a not at all different course did the sons of
      the Trojans arrange their steps and weave retreats and battles in
      their play&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The comparison here between the labyrinth and the games helps to
      illustrate the high level of intricacy and complexity of the boys&#x2019;
      maneuvers.<sup id="fnref:316"><a href="#fn:316" class="footnote">84</a></sup> The Cretan labyrinth was a marvel, after all, and one
      that was highly praised in antiquity for just such a reason.<sup id="fnref:317"><a href="#fn:317" class="footnote">85</a></sup> Yet
      the association between the details of this building and the boys&#x2019;
      spectacle might seem rather odd. The focus of the description is not so
      much on the labyrinth&#x2019;s complexity as it is on the deceptive nature of
      the structure: its walls deprive one of sight (cf.
      <em>parietibus&#x2026;caecis</em>, 590), and it contains a deceptive trick
      (<em>ancipitem&#x2026;dolum</em>, 590-591) due to its many, winding paths; even more
      than that, though, the labyrinth is a place where one can see neither
      where one has gone nor where one should go, trapping one in a constant
      state of <em>error</em> &#x2013; an <em>indeprensus et inremeablis error</em> (592).<sup id="fnref:318"><a href="#fn:318" class="footnote">86</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The emphasis of Vergil&#x2019;s simile is on the way that the labyrinth traps
      whoever enters it. That is surely not the quality which one would expect
      of a spectacle that is said to bring pleasure and a feeling of pride to
      its spectators. The poet has already told the reader that the Trojans
      &#x201C;receive the timid [boys] with applause, rejoice at the sight of
      them&#x2026;and recognize in them the faces of their old parents&#x201D; (<em>excipiunt
      plausu pauidos gaudentque tuentes&#x2026;ueterumque agnoscunt ora parentum</em>,
      <em>Aen</em>. 5.575-576). Let us think for a moment about this pleasure,
      though. It seems significant that the joy which the Trojans experience
      from watching the show comes from recognizing the past in the faces of
      their future. This is not, however, the past of Troy with which the
      readers of the poem are most familiar. The Troy that they have seen is
      merely a ruin, a place that was destroyed right before their eyes during
      Aeneas&#x2019; graphic narrative of the city&#x2019;s sack in Book 2. It might seem
      therefore that <em>Lusus Troiae</em> is helping the Trojans on one level, at
      least, in the way that it allows them to forget about the recent
      disaster that befell their homeland and at the same time to remember
      events of Troy&#x2019;s past that bring happiness to their hearts.</p>
      
      <p>If this is the case, though, why is there all the talk of deception in
      the simile that describes these same maneuvers? One way to answer this
      question, I would argue, is to suggest that the simile is emphasizing
      how the Trojans are &#x201C;trapped&#x201D; in a past they choose to remember,
      smoothing over the destruction of Troy that must still be paramount in
      their minds. The windings and twisting of the boys seem to be enough, in
      other words, to make the weary wanderers forget for a moment about the
      horrors that occurred at Troy and in the aftermath of its fall. The
      labyrinthine movements of the boys help to conceal a dark, chaotic time
      in the Trojans&#x2019; past &#x2013; to frame it in an elaborate fiction that presents
      to the Trojans only what they want to remember.<sup id="fnref:319"><a href="#fn:319" class="footnote">87</a></sup> It is only able to
      accomplish this, however, for as long as the show lasts. The Trojan
      women bring that <em>furor</em> back into their minds soon enough by burning
      the ships while the Trojan men are watching this mesmerizing
      spectacle.<sup id="fnref:320"><a href="#fn:320" class="footnote">88</a></sup> The labyrinthine dance thus proves a rather costly
      distraction for the Trojans: its complex borders and frames cannot
      actually keep the chaos of the past at bay for very long.<sup id="fnref:321"><a href="#fn:321" class="footnote">89</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It is not only the past that must enter into one&#x2019;s understanding of this
      simile, but the future of Rome, as well. Soon after the simile that
      juxtaposes the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> to the Cretan Labyrinth (and before the
      Trojan women&#x2019;s attack) the poet interrupts the narrative to discuss how
      this ritual would become very important to his own contemporary society:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hunc morem cursus atque haec certamina primus,
      Ascanius, Longam muris cum cingeret Albam,
      rettulit et priscos docuit celebrare Latinos,
      quo puer ipse modo, secum quo Troia pubes;
      Albani docuere suos; hinc maxima porro
      accepit Roma et patrium seruauit honorem;
      Troiaque nunc pueri, Troianum dicitur agmen. (<em>Aen</em>. 5.596-602)</p>
      
        <p>Ascanius was the first to bring back this kind of course and these
      games, when he was encircling Alba Long with walls, and taught the
      ancient Latins to celebrate them in the way that he as a boy had
      himself done, in the way that the Trojan youth had done with him. The
      Albans taught their own. From there greatest Rome later on received
      and kept the rite of their ancestors. Today the boys are called &#x201C;Troy&#x201D;
      and the column &#x201C;Trojan.&#x201D;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Why does the poet choose this moment to make explicit the aetiology of
      the event?<sup id="fnref:322"><a href="#fn:322" class="footnote">90</a></sup> Although the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> probably first appeared as
      an event in Rome in the time of Sulla (and Caesar used it in his triumph
      in 46 BCE), it was Augustus who revived the &#x201C;games&#x201D; on a greater
      scale.<sup id="fnref:323"><a href="#fn:323" class="footnote">91</a></sup> The aetiology might then be a way, it has been suggested,
      of &#x201C;complimenting Augustus by tracing the origin of the <em>lusus Troiae</em>
      to Aeneas and Ascanius.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:324"><a href="#fn:324" class="footnote">92</a></sup> However, the close proximity of this
      aetiology to the rather dark labyrinth simile might also lead a reader
      to understand this association in a less positive light.<sup id="fnref:325"><a href="#fn:325" class="footnote">93</a></sup> It might
      even be possible, for instance, to see the revival of the games as
      another attempt to give order to the chaos of a grim past of conflict &#x2013;
      just as the games do for the Trojans who see them performed for the
      first time.<sup id="fnref:326"><a href="#fn:326" class="footnote">94</a></sup> Is the attempt successful? At first, yes, it is, as
      the boys repeat the past in such a way as to bring pleasure to the
      Trojans. Yet this repetition distracts the Trojans not only from the
      horrors of their past that still follow them but also from the fact that
      they have not yet reached the solid land of Italy; and while they enjoy
      the spectacle, the Trojan women try to destroy their fleet.</p>
      
      <p>The labyrinth that the boys weave with their maneuvers conceals the
      chaos of the past that eventually does not stay subdued within the
      boundaries of their art. If understood in this way the labyrinth is
      employed in this passage to suggest how a structure that almost defies
      structure can trap its beholder in a constructed past through its many
      turns. The figure of the labyrinth cannot be controlled so easily,
      however.<sup id="fnref:327"><a href="#fn:327" class="footnote">95</a></sup> While the labyrinth might make the Trojans feel free from
      the always present sense of chaos in their past, as well as the one in
      their uncertain future, the poem demonstrates how that very same
      architectural frame is unstable and ultimately &#x201C;fails&#x201D; to control that
      chaos permanently. A labyrinth aims to entrap those who enter its
      boundaries, distracting them with its complexity while simultaneously
      letting go something more sinister as the boundaries between inside and
      outside shift. And if a labyrinth &#x2013; one of the great structures in the
      ancient world &#x2013; cannot succeed in containing such a <em>furor</em>, what faith
      should one put in the Temple of Janus to keep at bay the <em>Furor</em> of
      Rome&#x2019;s own recent past?</p>
      
      <h4 id="ii-the-labyrinthine-art-of-daedalus">(ii) The Labyrinthine Art of Daedalus</h4>
      
      <p>The labyrinthine spectacle of the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> alerts readers of the
      epic to the way that labyrinths can trap those who enter their winding,
      innumerable paths; in an even more nuanced way, though, Vergil&#x2019;s
      narrative of the games also demonstrate how labyrinths can for a time at
      least keep certain aspects of the past hidden, imposing a highly complex
      artistic frame &#x2013; a fiction of sorts &#x2013; that conceals something that one
      might want to forget. At the same time, however, such &#x201C;labyrinths&#x201D; fail
      to impose a permanent, stable structure on the chaotic, destructive
      forces of the past that could break out of them at any moment. They can
      provide momentary relief from the horrors of the past, in other words,
      but they cannot keep them from repeating.</p>
      
      <p>The next labyrinth that the reader encounters in the poem shares many of
      these same characteristics. It is again not part of the narrative, <em>per
      se</em>, but a small piece of an ecphrasis that details the life and works
      of the great craftsman Daedalus on the doors which he designed for the
      temple of Apollo upon his arrival at Cumae.<sup id="fnref:328"><a href="#fn:328" class="footnote">96</a></sup> As with the labyrinth
      simile in Book 5, moreover, Daedalus&#x2019; labyrinth &#x201C;fails&#x201D; as a structure
      to keep hidden the monsters and <em>errores</em> of the past that it was
      designed to conceal; if anything, in fact, such chaos is shown <em>through</em>
      Daedalus&#x2019; own art to break out of the architectural structure that
      frames it and thereby to re-enter the present.</p>
      
      <p>After the ships are saved by Jupiter from the Trojan women&#x2019;s fury Aeneas
      sails to Italy and finally makes landfall at Cumae at the start of Book
      6. He stops there in front of the doors of the temple of Apollo on his
      way to see the Sibyl to gaze at the reliefs carved upon them. This scene
      will be examined again in more detail in the following chapter that
      looks at the <em>monumenta</em> of the poem.<sup id="fnref:329"><a href="#fn:329" class="footnote">97</a></sup> For now, the focus will be
      on the labyrinth itself that is represented on the doors&#x2019; panels, as
      shown in the below passage:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
      Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
      Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
      hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.
      magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
      Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
      caeca regens filo uestigia. (<em>Aen</em>. 6.25-31)</p>
      
        <p>Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
      beneath [it] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
      the Minotaur, the <em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
      that toil of the house and the inescapable <em>error</em>. But indeed
      Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen&#x2019;s great love unlocks the
      tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The labyrinth was meant to conceal the Minotaur within its highly
      complex weaving of paths that the poet labels as <em>inextricabilis</em> (28),
      &#x201C;from which one cannot find a way [out].&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:330"><a href="#fn:330" class="footnote">98</a></sup> Yet this structure
      does not seem inescapable from the description of it here. Daedalus
      himself actually &#x201C;opens up&#x201D; the labyrinth by solving the very maze that
      he built to trap those who enter it (cf. <em>Daedalus ipse dolos tecti
      ambagesque resoluit</em>, / <em>caeca regens filo uestigia</em>, 30-31).<sup id="fnref:331"><a href="#fn:331" class="footnote">99</a></sup> Nor
      does the labyrinth depicted on the doors even hide the Minotaur: the
      beast &#x2013; and the sinful affair it represents &#x2013; is actually freed from the
      darkness of the labyrinth and displayed as on the doors for all to see.</p>
      
      <p>The architect can thus be said to break open his labyrinth: not only
      does he solve it in the myth itself; in a more unintentional way
      perhaps, he is also re-presenting to Aeneas (and the reader) the
      &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of his own construction to contain what was supposed to lie
      hidden by depicting the Minotaur on the doors and his own unlocking of
      the maze. Daedalus&#x2019; labyrinth is not just an example of &#x201C;failed&#x201D;
      architecture, therefore, but a <em>representation</em> of such failure.<sup id="fnref:332"><a href="#fn:332" class="footnote">100</a></sup>
      The master craftsman (as well as the poet describing his work) crascks
      open the labyrinth through his own art by revealing how to escape its
      twists and turns, its <em>errores</em>, as well as by depicting the monster
      that lies within them. In this way, then, the edifice might serve as a
      <em>mise en abyme</em> for the poem itself &#x2013; a poem which I have argued also
      reveals the violent chaos of the past that exists within several
      structures meant to contain it.<sup id="fnref:333"><a href="#fn:333" class="footnote">101</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>But what effect does such a release have? In the narrative, at least, it
      might seem like the outcome is rather negligible: Aeneas simply marvels
      at such <em>spectacula</em> (6.37) before the Sibyl comes and diverts his
      attention to more urgent matters.<sup id="fnref:334"><a href="#fn:334" class="footnote">102</a></sup> As William Fitzgerald suggests,
      however, the passage allows the labyrinth in the <em>Aeneid</em> to emerge as</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>a complex symbol of the status of the past. It is both a highly
      elaborate artistic work that freezes the past in a harmlessly
      discontinuous relation with the present and, as an instigator of
      repetition that transforms pattern into path, it offers the
      possibility of reactivating that past and assimilating it into the
      flow of history.<sup id="fnref:335"><a href="#fn:335" class="footnote">103</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Fitzgerald may be right to claim that labyrinths offer the &#x201C;possibility&#x201D;
      of bringing the past into a structured frame. It is only a possibility,
      though, and the results are only provisional at best, as additional
      analysis of this passage in the next chapter will reveal. By
      representing the monsters of Rome&#x2019;s violent past can the <em>Aeneid</em>
      provide a frame for containing them? Or does it run the risk of
      revealing and releasing what would rather be forgotten? Once again, the
      question arises of whether architectural structures &#x2013; even architecture
      as intricate as that of a labyrinth &#x2013; can really provide a permanent,
      stable frame that prevents the <em>furor</em> of Rome&#x2019;s past from breaking free
      of its bounds.</p>
      
      <p>This chapter has demonstrated that grand constructions such as cavernous
      <em>moles</em> and intricate labyrinths offer only the illusion of creating a
      frame that can contain the past within a stable narrative. The following
      chapter will show how the boundaries of monuments in the <em>Aeneid</em> also
      appear to be ineffectual in containing the chaos of the past that they
      represent within their artistic frames. As with the labyrinths examined
      above, moreover, the failure of the poem&#x2019;s <em>monumenta</em> is not so much in
      the collapse of their physical boundaries as it is in a breakdown of
      their epistemological borders &#x2013; which results in the release of the
      <em>errores</em> of the past so that they can repeat in the present. The same
      can be said for the <em>Aeneid</em> itself and its epic architexture as
      symbolized in magnificent Baldric of Pallas, whose resplendent frame is
      unable to keep the <em>furor</em> in Rome&#x2019;s past at bay.</p>
      
      <p>The poem does not show the &#x201C;cracks&#x201D; in its epic architexture to a wholly
      negative end, however. The failure of its architexture to provide a
      stable structure that can conceal and contain permanently the chaos it
      holds within it demonstrates at the same time the need to be aware of
      the fury that exists behind a monumental facade. For it is by being able
      to read beneath what one sees on the surface, I will argue, that the
      <em>Aeneid</em> shows how one can best prepare for &#x2013; and perhaps even prevent &#x2013;
      such a collapse of structure from occurring in the first place.</p>

            <p>This interest in the interior space of architecture is perhaps
      characteristically Roman &#x2013; in part, at least, because of the Romans&#x2019;
      ability to create much more dynamic spaces with the invention of
      concrete construction in the latter half of 2<sup>nd</sup> Century BCE. For
      the importance of this innovation for architecture, see Ling 1988,
      1672-1689, arguing that the ability to shape interior space through
      concrete was &#x201C;Rome&#x2019;s great legacy to posterity.&#x201D; As Ward-Perkins
      1981 [1994], 101, points out, in fact, &#x201C;[a]lready&#x2026;in the Roman
      architecture of the Late Republic one can detect a growing awareness
      of the properties of interior space.&#x201D; For a modern perspective of
      this issue, see also Wright 1928, 148-149, where the famous modern
      architect discusses Greek architecture as &#x201C;a mere matter of
      constructing decoration&#x201D; that led to a building that could be seen
      as &#x201C;a block of building material&#x2026;from the outside&#x201D; with no attention
      to what existed within. The Romans adopted the architecture of the
      Greeks, of course, but with an attention to interior spaces that was
      previously less significant. In a way similar to much modern
      architecture in Wright&#x2019;s estimation, Vergil&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> of a text
      also seeks for &#x201C;exterior expression&#x201D; (149), that is, to give a voice

      focuses upon the idea that &#x201C;the poem is very interested in the flux

      to behave, and why. [&#x2026;] [T]he longer Vergil pondered his

            <p>My reading of architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em> as &#x201C;failing&#x201D; to
      maintain its boundaries is influenced by Bartsch 1998. In this
      article on the ecphraseis of the poem Bartsch remarks on several of
      the same objects that I analyze in the current chapter, as well as
      in the next one (e.g., the Trojan horse, the Doors of Daedalus,
      Pallas&#x2019; Baldric). Bartsch likewise notes the problem with the
      boundaries of art to contain violent and chaotic forces that disrupt
      meaning and upset the established order of things, claiming that
      &#x201C;the artworks of the <em>Aeneid</em> participate in this economy of values
      that sets control and containment against the consequences of an
      impassioned violence. This attribute of the Virgilian artwork is
      counterbalanced, however, by its repeated failure to fulfill such a
      task: unable to restrain violence, the artwork literally lets it
      spill out, like a troop of murderous Greek warriors issuing from the
      carved cavity of a wooden horse&#x2019;s womb&#x201D; (322). My focus is not only
      on artworks, but on architectural structures, in particular, and how
      they influence the way that we understand Vergil&#x2019;s epic architexture

            <p>This is not the first time in the poem that the reader has come
      across the word <em>moles</em>. Nor is it the last, as we will see
      throughout the first part of this chapter. In the famous line that
      ends the proem of the <em>Aeneid</em>, for instance, Vergil asks the
      question: &#x201C;Was it of such a great effort (<em>molis</em>) to found
      (<em>condere</em>) the Roman race?&#x201D; (<em>tantae molis erat Romanum condere
      erat</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 1.33). Although the word obviously has a different
      meaning here, the operative metaphor is architectural with <em>condere</em>
      &#x2013; used just a few lines earlier to describe Aeneas&#x2019; task of founding
      a city in Italy (<em>multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem /
      inferretque deos Latio</em>, 1.5-6). And this &#x201C;effort&#x201D; is not just that
      of Aeneas, but it is the task of Vergil, as well, as he begins to
      construct his own massive epic poem on that difficult topic. To find
      the word again so soon afterwards, not more than thirty lines,
      suggests an indirect connection between (a poem on) founding Rome
      and the construction of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave &#x2013; which makes the latter&#x2019;s
      subsequent &#x201C;failure&#x201D; all the more ominous. On the parallel nature of

      according to the 20<sup>th</sup>-century Austrian philosopher, in fact,
      &#x201C;there can be no architecture where there is nothing to glorify&#x201D;
      (<em>Architektur verewigt und verherrlicht etwas. Darum kann es

      similar vein one of the most important architects of the 20<sup>th</sup> and
      now 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries, Daniel Libeskind, has recently claimed that
      &#x201C;all architecture is guided by memory, in forming our sense of
      space, of orientation, and our relationships with one another&#x201D;
      (2014, 165). The <em>Aeneid</em> seems to be suggesting that the converse

      suggests an association of Neptune with an Augustus-like politician

      did bring a sense of peace and order to Rome, the rebellion of the
      winds at the start of the epic might make one consider just how
      stable that peace really is. If Neptune (or Jupiter) is in control,
      for instance, how should the winds be able to break free at all? And
      are all the Aeolus-like figures who might want to overthrow the
      newly established order in Rome gone for good? It is not hard to

      before the hero even enters the cave. At 8.219-220, for instance,
      Hercules&#x2019; pain blazes with black gall (cf. <em>Alcidae furiis exarserat
      atro</em> / <em>felle dolor</em>); at line 230, moreover, he is described as
      &#x201C;blazing with anger&#x201D; (<em>fervidus ira</em>) because he cannot find a way
      into the cave. Even before his battle with the monster, then, it is
      possible to detect a monstrous change in the hero himself. For more

      Cacus see also: Doob 1990, 241, where she claims that although
      Hercules serves &#x201C;a model for Aeneas&#x201D; in certain respects, the hero&#x2019;s

      it by drawing a series of verbal parallels between Hercules and
      Cacus&#x201D;; and Henry 1989, 170-171, with the suggestion that &#x201C;[t]he
      strength as well as the brutality of Cacus is repeatedly emphasized

      194-212). [&#x2026;] It is because he must move so close to all these
      threatening nonhuman forces that Hercules runs so fearful a risk of

      uncertain of the direction in which science and technics are leading

      diacritical couples are unbalanced and perverted, etc., where the

      manifests itself. One can never see it in totality, nor can one

      share.&#x201D; There might even be a connection between the idea of the

      the Cretan labyrinth, for example, to the crane dance ritual on
      Delos as <em>tout naturellement</em> related in that they both not only
      have the same inventor in the figure of Daedalus, but also in that
      the dance &#x201C;appears as a new repetition of the same pattern, already

            <p>P. A. Miller 1995 also sees the <em>Lusus Troiae</em> as a &#x201C;strategy of
      containment.&#x201D; However, Miller&#x2019;s reading of the labyrinth presents it
      as &#x201C;symbolic&#x201D; (in the Lacanian sense) of &#x201C;the attempt to domesticate
      the chaotic powers associated with passion and the feminine&#x201D; (228).
      Indeed, for Miller, &#x201C;[t]he labyrinth as the symbolic functions as
      a mechanism of repression, which makes a controlled, socially
      sanctioned desire possible&#x201D; (234) and represents &#x201C;those patriarchal
      strategies of containment that try to shut out the other, both from
      within and without&#x201D; (240). See also Habinek 2005, 254-256, where he
      picks up on the symbolic nature of the labyrinth as &#x201C;feminine,&#x201D; in
      that &#x201C;[t]he knowledge acquired by the journey into and return from
      the labyrinth&#x2026;is also knowledge of the innards of the body, whether
      construed as entrails or female sexual organs or both.&#x201D; (254). It is
      interesting to note in the context of this passage, moreover, that
      the idea of the labyrinth as &#x201C;imposing order on chaos&#x201D; might be a
      particularly Roman idea. See McEwan 1993, 60, who argues that
      &#x201C;[t]he Western tradition has been to interpret the skillful
      embrace of <em>aporia</em> revealed through the construction of&#x2026;[the]
      Labyrinth as a question of imposing order on chaos. This is a
      misrepresentation whose roots may well lie with the Romans.&#x201D; <a href="#fnref:319" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

      a rite that was performed at the founding of cities or as an
      initiation rite for young boys into manhood. P. A. Miller 1995, 234,
      agrees with this interpretation, suggesting that the event functions

      of war and peace-making which constitute Rome&#x2019;s art.&#x201D; The above
