    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5. The Cracks in Vergil&#x2019;s Epic Architexture II</h2>
    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>The previous chapter examined several examples of &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architecture
      in the <em>Aeneid</em>. These included in particular the constructed caves and
      the artful labyrinths meant to cover over and contain chaotic forces and
      elements of the past that would upset any established order imposed upon
      them. It is now time to see what this analysis brings to bear on how one
      might understand the <em>monumenta</em> in the poem and ultimately the
      monumental architexture of epic itself.</p>
      
      <p>Part 1 of this chapter will analyze three of the poem&#x2019;s <em>monumenta</em>,
      namely, those on Crete that Anchises mentions in Book 3, those embodied
      by the Minotaur in Book 6, and those at the site of Rome that Evander
      shows to Aeneas in Book 8. By putting these <em>monumenta</em> within the
      context of the other architectural structures of the poem discussed in
      Chapter IV it becomes possible to see that they too are often
      unsuccessful in achieving a stable meaning, revealing the &#x201C;cracks&#x201D; in
      their epistemological foundations.<sup id="fnref:336"><a href="#fn:336" class="footnote">1</a></sup> These &#x201C;failed&#x201D; monuments should
      alert the reader to the instability of meaning inherent to monuments
      that has the potential to upset any stable narrative of the past (and
      future) that the monuments of the Augustan age &#x2013; whether Augustus&#x2019; or
      that of the <em>Aeneid</em> itself &#x2013; might try to establish.</p>
      
      <p>Part 2 will then build upon the conclusions reached regarding
      architectural boundaries and monuments in the poem in order to arrive at
      a definition of Vergil&#x2019;s own architexture. Whereas Horace sought to
      stabilize the borders of his genre while subtly introducing extrageneric
      and novel material, Vergil&#x2019;s poem shows us in contrast how the external
      facade of epic that he places upon his story of Rome is unstable: his
      epic frame cannot ultimately keep the chaotic forces of the Roman past
      from breaking through and disrupting a tidy teleological narrative from
      Aeneas to Augustus. An analysis of the <em>monumenta</em> on the Baldric of
      Pallas &#x2013; read often as a <em>mise-en</em>-<em>abyme</em> for the poem itself &#x2013; will
      serve to weave together the threads of thought from the preceding
      section and allow us to arrive at some general conclusions regarding the
      poem&#x2019;s overall architextural structure. Like the frame of the baldric, I
      propose, the poem as a monument of Roman history fails to contain the
      chaos (actual and epistemological) that is a significant component of
      Rome&#x2019;s story as Vergil tells it &#x2013; a failure that is most apparent when
      Aeneas slaughters the injured and defenseless Turnus after seeing the
      baldric. It might then appear based on this reading that the <em>Aeneid</em>
      itself is just as much a &#x201C;failed&#x201D; <em>monumentum</em> as the ones that it
      contains.</p>
      
      <p>Yet, as I argue in Part 3, it is the very &#x201C;failure&#x201D; of the <em>Aeneid</em> as a
      monument that perhaps makes it a monumental success in the way in which
      the poem causes its readers to reflect upon the nature of monuments.
      What the <em>Aeneid</em> suggests is not that the instability of meaning makes
      all <em>monumenta</em> failures, <em>per se</em>, but that to appreciate a monument
      fully and learn all it has to tell us about the past we need be aware of
      the multiplicity of meanings that lie underneath what appears on its
      magnificent exterior. It is in this way, in fact, that I argue the poem
      can illustrate for its readers that the very power of a monument
      actually lies not only in its apparent stability (literal and
      epistemological) that Horace stressed, but also in the awareness on the
      part of the spectator of the monument&#x2019;s capacity to fail &#x2013; without which
      the &#x201C;immortality&#x201D; that a monument promises would have little meaning. As
      I suggest in concluding, moreover, this same polysemy of monuments did
      not escape Augustus, either, in his use of monuments in the <em>Res Gestae</em>
      to remember Rome&#x2019;s own chaotic past &#x2013; good and bad &#x2013; while
      simultaneously giving his subjects hope for a better present and future.
      The nuanced way that the <em>princeps</em> describes the Temple of Janus in
      particular provides an interesting parallel to the sophisticated
      architextural <em>monumentum</em> that the <em>Aeneid</em> represents.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-1-vergilian-monumenta">Part 1. Vergilian <em>Monumenta</em></h3>
      
      <p>The previous chapter briefly mentioned the <em>monumenta</em> that Evander
      shows to Aeneas in Book 8. These are the only <em>monumenta</em> in the poem
      that are strictly architectural. At the same time, though, the poem is
      filled with several non-architectural <em>monumenta</em> that require attention
      for understanding what kind of monument the epic poem itself can be said
      to represent.<sup id="fnref:337"><a href="#fn:337" class="footnote">2</a></sup> This part of the present chapter will analyze a few
      of the most important <em>monumenta</em> in the poem before turning at last to
      the structures found at the proto-Rome of Evander. This brief survey
      will demonstrate not only that these monuments &#x201C;fail&#x201D; to maintain a
      stable meaning; it will also show, more importantly, that this
      instability of meaning leads to the kind of chaos and <em>errores</em> of the
      past that the failed structures examined in Chapter IV also could not
      contain.</p>
      
      <p>The very first time that word <em>monumentum</em> appears in the poem should
      not inspire confidence in the reader for the ability of &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; to
      present a stable and unambiguous meaning. When the Trojans are trying to
      decode Apollo&#x2019;s prophecy that they should &#x201C;seek their ancient mother&#x201D;
      (<em>antiquam exquirite matrem</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 3.96), Anchises calls upon
      <em>monumenta</em> in order to find a solution to the puzzle:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>tum genitor ueterum uoluens monumenta uirorum
      &#x201C;audite, o proceres,&#x201D; ait &#x201C;et spes discite uestras.
      Creta Iouis magni medio iacet insula ponto,
      mons ldaeus ubi et gentis cunabula nostrae. (<em>Aen</em>. 3.102-1065</p>
      
        <p>&#x201C;Hear me, leaders,&#x201D; said my father, revolving in his mind the
      <em>monumenta</em> of ancient men, &#x201C;and learn what you can hope for. Crete
      lies in the middle of the sea, the island of mighty Jove, where there
      exists a Mt. Ida and the cradle of our race.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Aeneas&#x2019; father advises the Trojans to go to Crete where they can find
      their origins, that is, their <em>cunabula</em> (&#x201C;cradle,&#x201D; 105). This is the
      place, Anchises continues, where Cybele&#x2019;s cult originated with its
      brazen symbols (cf. 3.111). The founder of Troy himself first came from
      this island, too &#x2013; if Anchises remembers correctly (<em>si rite audita
      recordor</em>, 107) &#x2013; and &#x201C;therefore&#x201D; (<em>ergo</em>, 114) it must be where the
      Trojans should found their city. This is not the right interpretation of
      Apollo&#x2019;s prophecy, of course. What one should note here is the fact that
      it is specifically <em>monumenta</em> that cause Anchises to make such a
      mistake. They lead him and his fellow Trojans, in other words, to
      continue the <em>errores</em> that they have endured to that point since
      departing from the shores of Troy.</p>
      
      <p>The very first set of <em>monumenta</em> in the poem is thus a &#x201C;failure.&#x201D;
      Anchises&#x2019; mistake illustrates for the reader not just that monuments
      fail to provide their interpreters with a clear message; more than that,
      the failure here demonstrates that these structures can mislead their
      interpreters, too, as happens with the Trojans when they try impose
      their own meanings and desires upon them. The passage suggests, in other
      words, that the failure of a monument to achieve a single, stable
      meaning allows for the weary Trojans to fit these monuments &#x2013; regardless
      of their original meaning &#x2013; into an interpretation that on the one hand
      suits their desire for a new home, but on the other is still geared to
      their past and thus leads them away from arriving at their new
      future.<sup id="fnref:338"><a href="#fn:338" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>An even more complicated &#x201C;monument&#x201D; is the one which the labyrinth on
      Daedalus&#x2019; Doors both hides and makes its viewers remember, namely, the
      Minotaur represented in the carvings and labeled as the <em>Veneris
      monumenta nefandae</em> (<em>Aen</em>. 6.21),<sup id="fnref:339"><a href="#fn:339" class="footnote">4</a></sup> as discussed in the previous
      chapter.<sup id="fnref:340"><a href="#fn:340" class="footnote">5</a></sup> These <em>monumenta</em> are of particular importance since they
      present in an explicit way both the attempt to control the past through
      monumental structures and the failure of that effort.<sup id="fnref:341"><a href="#fn:341" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Here is the
      passage again in full:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hic crudelis amor tauri suppostaque furto
      Pasiphae mixtumque genus prolesque biformis
      Minotaurus inest, Veneris monimenta nefandae,
      hic labor ille domus et inextricabilis error.</p>
      
        <p>magnum reginae sed enim miseratus amorem
      Daedalus ipse dolos tecti ambagesque resoluit,
      caeca regens filo uestigia. (<em>Aen</em>. 6.25-31)</p>
      
        <p>Here is displayed the cruel love of a bull, here Pasiphae placed
      beneath [it] secretly, here the mixed race and two-formed offspring,
      the Minotaur, the <em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus. Here is displayed
      that toil of the house and the inescapable <em>error</em>. But indeed
      Daedalus himself taking pity on the queen&#x2019;s great love unlocks the
      tricks and twists of the house, leading blind footsteps with a string.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>To label the Minotaur as the &#x201C;<em>monumenta</em> of a criminal Venus&#x201D; would
      seem to exonerate Daedalus in the narrative he presents. As William
      Fitzgerald has suggested, in fact, the &#x201C;configuration is notable for its
      absolute lack of Daedalus, who does not feature in Pasiphae&#x2019;s
      escapade.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:342"><a href="#fn:342" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Indeed, although the master craftsman was the one who
      built the cow which allowed Pasiphae to copulate with the bull, he
      appears nowhere in this part of the doorframe. By presenting the story
      in this way, then, Daedalus is able to elide his own role from the
      Minotaur&#x2019;s conception &#x2013; making the creature the fault of a
      <em>Veneris&#x2026;nefandae</em> (27). At the same time, however, by representing
      the Minotaur at all the artist fails to keep hidden the horrors of his
      own past. Instead of allowing this evil to lie concealed in the past
      Daedalus instead monumentalizes it for all to see and thus forever keeps
      his own <em>errores</em> on display regardless of the label that is given to
      the creature.<sup id="fnref:343"><a href="#fn:343" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The architect cannot escape from the horrible
      mistakes of his past even by providing a frame that re-interprets them
      in a way more sympathetic to him. Aestheticizing the past through
      <em>monumenta</em> cannot fully hide Daedalus&#x2019; mistakes, in other words, no
      matter how brilliant and mesmerizing those monumental golden doors
      appear.</p>
      
      <p>Before we move on to examining the <em>monumenta</em> of proto-Rome it seems
      relevant to note that while Daedalus&#x2019; selective depiction of the past
      can only be inferred from the passage discussed above, it becomes
      abundantly clear in the way that the master craftsman depicts (or rather
      does not depict) his dead son Icarus on the same doors.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;Tu quoque magnam
      partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes.
      bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro,
      bis patriae cecidere manus&#x2026; (<em>Aen</em>. 6.30-33)</p>
      
        <p>You too would have an important part in so great a work, Icarus, were
      grief to allow it. Twice [Daedalus] had tried to fashion your fall
      in gold, twice the father&#x2019;s hands fell&#x2026;</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In this passage Vergil explicitly tells the reader that Daedalus cannot
      fashion the fall of his son &#x2013; an incident that is the fault of his
      creations yet again &#x2013; for his hands cannot but fall (cf. <em>cecidere</em>, 33)
      when he tries to complete the frame.<sup id="fnref:344"><a href="#fn:344" class="footnote">9</a></sup> But Icarus is there,
      nonetheless, brought before the readers&#x2019; eyes by the poet himself
      through an apostrophe to the fallen boy.<sup id="fnref:345"><a href="#fn:345" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Whereas the absence of
      Daedalus from the frames above goes unmentioned by the poet, this final
      scene demonstrates more explicitly the way that the ingenious inventor
      is ultimately not able to keep hidden in his art the mistakes of his
      past. The conspicuous absence of Icarus that the poet notes transforms
      the doors into a monument not just to Daedalus&#x2019; dead son but also to the
      pain that he felt at having lost him. Vergil thus monumentalizes
      Daedalus&#x2019; grief for his son &#x2013; even when it was the intention of the
      Athenian inventor to leave out of the frame the fall that he had caused
      for the pain it would bring him to reproduce it.</p>
      
      <p>By representing his story in the pictorial medium Daedalus is able to
      frame his past, giving it a kind of rigid structure. That does not mean,
      though, that he can control what others read back into that fictional
      frame. The events and details of his past that are not represented there
      can be made present by its interpreters even when Deadalus does not
      depict them &#x2013; thus making it impossible for him to escape the past that
      he would clearly rather forget.<sup id="fnref:346"><a href="#fn:346" class="footnote">11</a></sup> He can try all he might to give a
      stable narrative to that past, to cover over its horrors in gold
      carvings. Yet the <em>monumenta</em> that the Minotaur represents within these
      frames can be read as symbolizing the <em>errores</em> of the artisan just as
      readily as they can be interpreted as the fault of &#x201C;Venus.&#x201D; In other
      words, the fact that the Minotaur is presented at all allows
      interpreters to read back into the myth those very mistakes that
      Daedalus might have wanted to leave out of his wondrous, intricate
      construction. In the end, therefore, even a master craftsman such as
      Daedalus is shown as unable to build a stable monument that would ease
      his suffering.<sup id="fnref:347"><a href="#fn:347" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The surface meaning of the monument &#x2013; as the
      labyrinth itself &#x2013; is not firm but can be broken down to reveal
      additional meanings that lie beneath its resplendent, magnificent
      surface.</p>
      
      <p>The <em>monumenta</em> that Anchises uses to interpret the prophecy of Apollo
      fail him, misleading him and his fellow Trojans into further <em>errores</em>.
      The <em>monumenta</em> that the Minotaur represents fail to save Daedalus from
      reliving his own <em>errores</em> of the past but instead perpetuate them. It
      should be no surprise, then, when problems of interpretation also
      accompany the only time when Vergil uses <em>monumenta</em> in an explicitly
      architectural sense, namely, in his description of the place that will
      one day become Rome.<sup id="fnref:348"><a href="#fn:348" class="footnote">13</a></sup> To whom are these structures &#x201C;monuments&#x201D;?
      Evander sees them as meaning one thing, Aeneas perhaps as meaning
      something else in his amazement. What about Roman readers, though? What
      do these incredibly ancient <em>monumenta</em> mean to them? In the passages
      analyzed below the problem is one a multiplicity of viewpoints that
      confuse or at the very least destabilize the meaning that the
      <em>monumenta</em> might have.</p>
      
      <p>Vergil introduces Aeneas&#x2019; famous &#x201C;tour&#x201D; Rome in Book 8 of the poem with
      the following passage:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;ibat rex obsitus aeuo
      et comitem Aenean iuxta natumque tenebat
      ingrediens uarioque uiam sermone leuabat.
      miratur facilisque oculos fert omnia circum
      Aeneas capiturque locis et singula laetus
      exquiritque auditque uirum monumenta priorum. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.307-312)</p>
      
        <p>The king went forth, besieged with age, and as he progressed he held
      Aeneas and his own son nearby as companions and lightened their way
      with various talk. Aeneas marvels and moves his eyes eagerly over all
      things. He is captivated by the places, happily asking and hearing one
      at a time about the <em>monumenta</em> of former men.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>What is at first simply a way to lighten the journey through
      conversation becomes something by which Aeneas is utterly &#x201C;captivated&#x201D;
      (<em>capitur</em>, 311) as he marvels at what he sees &#x2013; much as he did in front
      of Daedalus&#x2019; Doors in Book 6.<sup id="fnref:349"><a href="#fn:349" class="footnote">14</a></sup> The difference in this case is that
      he has a guide to explain the different &#x201C;monuments of former men&#x201D;
      (<em>uirum monumenta priorum</em>, 312). But what exactly are these
      <em>monumenta</em>? The first &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; that Evander mentions are merely
      &#x201C;groves&#x201D; (<em>nemora</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 8.314) where the Nymphs and the first
      inhabitants of the place dwelled. The Greek king then goes on for 28
      lines to tell Aeneas about the way things used to be in the &#x201C;golden age&#x201D;
      of Saturn, when no laws were needed and everything was in abundance,
      before briefly explaining his own journey to the place itself and the
      founding of his city.<sup id="fnref:350"><a href="#fn:350" class="footnote">15</a></sup> If Evander is also a recent immigrant,
      though, how does he know the way things used to be in these lands which
      seem uninhabited upon his arrival except for the monster Cacus discussed
      in the previous chapter? Are these bare sites themselves all the
      &#x201C;evidence&#x201D; that remains of these events? Although there is only a hint
      of the ambiguity of meaning of these <em>monumenta</em> here, they set the tone
      for the rest of the passage which is likewise filled with such problems
      of perspective to an even greater degree.</p>
      
      <p>In the intervening lines before Evander speaks again Vergil narrates
      more of the tour that the king gives to Aeneas, pointing out several
      more &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; along the way:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;dehinc progressus monstrat et aram
      et Carmentalem Romani nomine portam
      quam memorant, nymphae priscum Carmentis honorem,
      uatis fatidicae, cecinit quae prima futuros
      Aeneadas magnos et nobile Pallanteum.
      hinc lucum ingentem, quem Romulus acer asylum
      rettulit&#x2026;monstrat&#x2026; (<em>Aen</em>. 8.337-343)</p>
      
        <p>Then having gone ahead he shows both the altar and the gate which the
      Romans call Carmental, the ancient honor of the Nymph Carmentis, the
      fate-speaking prophetess, who first sang that the sons of Aeneas would
      be great and Pallanteum would be noble. From this place he shows a
      vast grove, which the fierce Romulus restored as an asylum.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Evander shows Aeneas &#x201C;the Carmentaline Gate&#x201D; (<em>Carmentalem&#x2026;portam</em>,
      338) and the immense &#x201C;grove&#x201D; (<em>lucum</em>, 342) which Romulus would come to
      use as an asylum. Yet these both appear to be anachronistic <em>monumenta</em>
      at least from the way that Vergil describes them. The Carmentaline Gate
      commemorates the &#x201C;ancient honor&#x201D; (<em>priscum&#x2026;honorem</em>, 339) of the
      <em>vates</em> Carmens who first sang about the great sons of Aeneas and noble
      Pallanteum (the city that Evander and Aeneas are currently touring).
      While this edifice is thus a typical <em>monumentum</em> in the sense that it
      commemorates someone in the past, it is hard to know whether these words
      are Vergil&#x2019;s commentary or a paraphrase of Evander&#x2019;s own description.
      Does the king himself know that Carmens actually sang about the
      <em>Aeneadae</em>? It would seem likely since she is his mother, after all (cf.
      <em>Aen</em>. 8.335-336). If he does know of this prophecy, though, it would
      surely be strange that he has not already mentioned it to Aeneas and his
      <em>Aeneadae</em>. But regardless of whether or not this is Vergil&#x2019;s paraphrase
      of Evander&#x2019;s own words Aeneas is surely not seeing this <em>monumentum</em> in
      the same way as a Roman reader would from the future. The meaning of the
      monument for him (and Evander) is different from what it would have
      meant to Vergil&#x2019;s Roman readers, who might know of these prophecies and
      their ultimate fulfillment from their perspective in the future.</p>
      
      <p>Admittedly, there might still be a certain amount of ambiguity regarding
      how much Evander knows about the Carmentaline Gate: he might know about
      the prophecy, or he might not. Any such uncertainty of how much
      knowledge Evander has of the &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; that he is showing to Aeneas
      disappears completely in the case of the second <em>monumentum</em> mentioned
      in this passage, namely, the asylum of Romulus. There is simply no way
      that Evander could know of Romulus; for the Greek ex-pat, at least, the
      grove can only be notable (if at all) because of its great size
      (<em>ingentem</em>, 342). And the same no doubt goes for Aeneas&#x2019; interpretation
      of this &#x201C;monument,&#x201D; as well. Only a reader of the epic would be able to
      interpret this grove for its historical value. This is not the only time
      on Evander&#x2019;s tour that the reader encounters such an ambiguity of
      meaning between Rome&#x2019;s past and present:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolia ducit
      aurea nunc, olim siluestribus horrida dumis. (<em>Aen</em>. 8.347-348)</p>
      
        <p>[Evander] leads [Aeneas] from here to the Tarpeian seat and the
      Capitoline, now golden, formerly bristling with forest-thorns.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The Tarpeian &#x201C;seat&#x201D; (<em>sedem</em>, 347) obviously cannot have any historical
      value to Evander; it would be another 500 years before Tarpeia would
      betray her city (cf. Liv. 1.11). And the Capitoline for the two of them
      is merely &#x201C;bristling with forest-thorns&#x201D; (<em>siluestribus horrida dumis</em>,
      348). This is not the case for a Roman reader, however, who as Vergil
      points out would have associated the Capitoline with the &#x201C;now golden&#x201D;
      (<em>aurea nunc</em>, 348) roofs of its buildings.<sup id="fnref:351"><a href="#fn:351" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>There are clearly some strange anachronisms that emerge from this
      passage.<sup id="fnref:352"><a href="#fn:352" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Vergil&#x2019;s Augustan readers do not see the <em>monumenta</em> that
      Aeneas and Evander do in both a physical and historical sense.<sup id="fnref:353"><a href="#fn:353" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Yet
      Aeneas is said to &#x201C;marvel&#x201D; (<em>miratur</em>) at them &#x2013; whatever they are &#x2013; and
      &#x201C;happily&#x201D; (<em>laetus</em>, 8.311), too. Evander&#x2019;s tour thus illustrates not
      only the way that <em>monumenta</em> can change meaning depending on their
      viewer; just as important, these passages shows that ignorance of what a
      monument means does not stop a viewer from enjoying them &#x2013; as was noted
      above, for example, with the Trojans&#x2019; fateful enjoyment of the
      monumental Horse in Book II.<sup id="fnref:354"><a href="#fn:354" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>It is the perspective of the viewer that ultimately gives these
      monuments their meaning(s). This is not say that these architectural
      &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; are &#x201C;failures&#x201D; in quite as an explicitly negative way as
      either the <em>monumenta</em> that Anchises (mis)remembers or the ones that
      Daedalus carves. The <em>monumenta</em> that Evander shows to Aeneas amaze and
      inspire the Trojan leader, after all. Nevertheless, when one takes into
      account the failures of the architectural structures analyzed in
      previous chapter and those of the <em>monumenta</em> in this chapter, it would
      not seem inappropriate to read the ambiguity of meaning that Evander&#x2019;s
      &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; present in a less than positive light, as well. Although
      their external appearance (or name) might suggest a certain association,
      such an association is particular to the perspective of the onlooker &#x2013;
      whether as a character in the poem, the narrator, or the reader. And
      different &#x201C;readers&#x201D; (including Aeneas and Evander) will no doubt bring
      their own interpretations. It is certainly the case, for instance, that
      the tour means something very different to a modern reader from what it
      might have meant to one who lived in Rome at the time that Vergil was
      writing.</p>
      
      <p>What these scenes from Evander&#x2019;s tour therefore demonstrate to their
      readers is the way that architectural <em>monumenta</em> can amaze even when
      the audience does not fully understand what they mean. It would seem
      that sometimes only the outward appearance of monumentality &#x2013; regardless
      of its meaning or what it commemorates &#x2013; is enough for a structure to
      make an impact on its audience, or simply to appear monumental. Where
      these monuments &#x201C;fail&#x201D; is in the sense that without the proper knowledge
      of the past (or in Evander and Aeneas&#x2019; case the future) such structures
      or places can amaze but cannot impart the meaning they were perhaps
      meant to commemorate, whether good or bad.<sup id="fnref:355"><a href="#fn:355" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Without their stories
      these monuments still manage through their external appearance to cause
      their audiences to consider the significance of these spaces, even if
      only to be in awe of them; where they &#x201C;fail&#x201D; is in their inability to
      keep a stable frame on prior events which can help one to avoid
      repeating past <em>errores</em>. Who built the <em>monumenta</em> that Evander shows
      to Aeneas, one may ask, and more importantly what happened to them and
      their civilization so that all they leave behind in Evander&#x2019;s time are
      these monumental &#x201C;relics&#x201D; (<em>reliquas</em>, 8.356)?<sup id="fnref:356"><a href="#fn:356" class="footnote">21</a></sup> Might it be that
      Rome could one day return to ruins whose original meaning no one would
      know? These are the kinds of questions that are raised when one
      considers these <em>monumenta</em> in the context of the other &#x201C;failed&#x201D;
      structures that the poem contains.</p>
      
      <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> has been shown in this chapter and the last one to be full
      of monumental structures whose very boundaries are revealed to be
      unstable, epistemologically as much as physically. Their awe-inspiring
      surfaces can cause one to forget what one should remember; or put in
      another way, their magnificent frames can keep hidden &#x2013; and thus alive &#x2013;
      that which one might want to forget. The same can be said for the
      architexture of the poem itself, as the next part of this chapter will
      now suggest.</p>
      
      <h3 id="part-2-vergilian-architexture-fractured-frames-of-meaning">Part 2. Vergilian Architexture: Fractured Frames of Meaning</h3>
      
      <p>The architecture in the <em>Aeneid</em> &#x2013; both in its failed constructions and
      ambiguous <em>monumenta</em> &#x2013; sets the foundation for a much different kind of
      architexture for Vergil than for Horace in his <em>Odes</em>. The epic poet
      focuses not so much on how to bring new elements into his generic
      boundaries without destabilizing them as on what happens when one tries
      to frame the violence and chaos of the past &#x2013; and, in particular, Rome&#x2019;s
      past &#x2013; within the grand and monumental structure of epic that the proem
      of <em>Georgics</em> 3 suggested the <em>Aeneid</em> might be.<sup id="fnref:357"><a href="#fn:357" class="footnote">22</a></sup> As the balance of
      this chapter will show, however, the poem&#x2019;s apparent failure in this
      regard is not nearly so important as the sophisticated representation of
      that failure which the <em>Aeneid</em> provides &#x2013; as well as the lessons it can
      thereby offer to its readers, ancient and modern.</p>
      
      <p>The analysis of architecture and monuments in this chapter and the last
      one has demonstrated two issues that might arise when one attempts to
      construct an epic poem as a frame for the chaotic forces that are a part
      of Rome&#x2019;s story from the start. Architectural constructions are
      repeatedly shown, on the one hand, as a means to contain chaotic forces
      of Rome&#x2019;s past that would upset any order which one might try to impose
      upon them &#x2013; and they are repeatedly shown to fail at keeping such forces
      restrained and hidden. The artificial boundaries placed upon the fury of
      the winds, the Greeks, and Cacus are ultimately broken and release such
      forces to wreak havoc on the world of Rome&#x2019;s origins. Even the labyrinth
      (whether metaphoric or real) is shown to be ineffectual at keeping at
      bay such forces permanently &#x2013; not only distracting the onlooker from the
      chaos contained through the complex artistry of its structure, but also
      forever monumentalizing the <em>errores</em> of the past in its shifting
      architectural frame that cannot be controlled.</p>
      
      <p>It is not just the chaos under the surface, on the other hand, that
      Vergil is bringing to light in the <em>Aeneid</em>. The poem&#x2019;s failed
      <em>monumenta</em> also bring one&#x2019;s attention to the problems with the
      magnificent frames placed upon such destructive forces. Neither those
      who produce nor those who receive such <em>monumenta</em> can give them a
      stable meaning which will endure. There are some meanings, moreover,
      that simply cannot be contained &#x2013; even if one wants to forget them.
      Horace&#x2019;s poetry showed how two opposed meanings can create a tension
      that allows a structure to evolve without its traditional boundaries
      being compromised. If a <em>monumentum</em> can have two meanings at once,
      however, who is to say it cannot have even more meanings &#x2013; many more
      meanings &#x2013; so many that those stable boundaries begin to crack?<sup id="fnref:358"><a href="#fn:358" class="footnote">23</a></sup>
      Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em> suggests a possible answer to that question. Its epic
      surface no matter how grand it might appear cannot in the end provide a
      stable frame for the chaos that inhabits Rome&#x2019;s past and haunts its
      present.</p>
      
      <p>These two issues &#x2013; the inefficacy of an epic frame to contain the
      destructive forces of the past and to maintain a single, stable meaning
      &#x2013; are brought together in the poem&#x2019;s final set of <em>monumenta</em>: the
      Baldric of Pallas. This object has also been seen as a <em>mise-en-abyme</em>
      of the poem itself in a way not dissimilar to Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> in
      the finale of his first collection of <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:359"><a href="#fn:359" class="footnote">24</a></sup> The belt is not
      architectural, of course. It does further illustrate, however, the way
      that a monument&#x2019;s lack of stability in terms of its meaning can lead men
      to commit the same violent mistakes of the past by releasing the violent
      forces that it both commemorates and tries to frame. Its frame is
      revealed to be just as susceptible to &#x201C;collapse,&#x201D; in fact, as the
      boundaries of Aeolus&#x2019; Cave, the Trojan Horse, the Cave of Cacus, or the
      poem&#x2019;s labyrinths &#x2013; and with similar disastrous results when those
      boundaries fail. The baldric is &#x201C;unique,&#x201D; moreover, in that it is the
      only set of <em>monumenta</em> described at length in the poem that is also (in
      terms of its content at least) a part of an actual architectural
      monument in Augustan Rome, namely, the relief of the Danaids in the
      portico of Apollo&#x2019;s temple on the Palatine.<sup id="fnref:360"><a href="#fn:360" class="footnote">25</a></sup> For these reasons,
      then, an analysis of the baldric&#x2019;s <em>monumenta</em> will serve as a fitting
      way to conclude this investigation and come to some conclusions
      regarding Vergil&#x2019;s monumental and &#x201C;failed&#x201D; architexture.</p>
      
      <p>When Turnus begs for his life after being wounded by Aeneas at the very
      end of the poem the Trojan leader hesitates for a moment (<em>cunctantem</em>,
      <em>Aen</em>. 12.940) as the words of the fallen native Italian begin to sway
      him to take pity. It is at that moment, however, that Aeneas sees that
      Turnus is wearing Pallas&#x2019; baldric &#x2013; the sign of the enemy side
      (<em>inimicum insigne</em>, 12.944) &#x2013; which Turnus not only took from the son
      of Evander after slaying him without mercy, but which he also
      re-appropriated for his own use. The sight of this piece of armor causes
      a strong reaction in Aeneas, as Vergil describes in the epic&#x2019;s famous
      final lines:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>ille, oculis postquam saeui monumenta doloris
      exuuiasque hausit, furiis accensus et ira
      terribilis: tune hinc spoliis indute meorum
      eripiare mihi? Pallas te hoc uulnere, Pallas
      immolat et poenam scelerato ex sanguine sumit.&#x201D;
      hoc dicens ferrum aduerso sub pectore condit
      feruidus; ast illi soluuntur frigore membra
      uitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras. (<em>Aen</em>. 12.945-952)</p>
      
        <p>[Aeneas], after he drank in the <em>monumenta</em> of savage grief and the
      spoils with his eyes, inflamed with furies and terrible in his wrath:
      &#x201C;Will you be snatched away from me while dressed in the spoils of my
      own people? Pallas sacrifices you with this wound, Pallas exacts
      payment from your wicked blood.&#x201D; Saying this, in a rage, he founds his
      sword in the opposed chest. Turnus&#x2019; limbs are loosened with cold and
      angrily his life flees with a groan down into the shadows.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>These <em>monumenta</em> represent the most complex set of &#x201C;monuments&#x201D; in the
      poem. Even more than with any of the monuments examined above there are
      in this passage multiple potential viewers and multiple people/events
      that the <em>monumenta</em> might be commemorating.<sup id="fnref:361"><a href="#fn:361" class="footnote">26</a></sup> First of all, for
      Aeneas, the baldric is a reminder not only of Pallas himself, but also
      of the &#x201C;savage grief&#x201D; (<em>saeui&#x2026;doloris</em>, 945) that he feels at Turnus&#x2019;
      act of slaying the young Greek.<sup id="fnref:362"><a href="#fn:362" class="footnote">27</a></sup> For Turnus, on the other hand,
      these are &#x201C;spoils&#x201D; (<em>exuuias</em>, 946; <em>spoliis</em>, 947) in which he formerly
      &#x201C;rejoices and takes delight&#x201D; (<em>ouat&#x2026;gaudetque</em>, <em>Aen</em>. 10.500) when he
      rips them from Pallas&#x2019; dead body in Book 10; they are from his
      perspective simply a sign of his own military prowess. Turnus thus
      clearly interprets these <em>monumenta</em> rather differently from Aeneas. Yet
      there is another perspective to consider here, namely, that of the poet
      himself. When Turnus picks up the baldric in Book 10 the poet intrudes
      to lament humankind&#x2019;s ignorance of the future:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae
      et seruare modum rebus sublata secundis!
      Turno tempus erit magna cum optauerit emptum
      intactum Pallanta et cum spolia ista diemque
      oderit. (<em>Aen</em>. 10.501-505)</p>
      
        <p>O the mind of mortals, unknowing of fate and future lot, ignorant of
      how to keep proper measure when lifted up by favorable affairs! There
      will be a time when Turnus will have wished he could buy the untouched
      body of Pallas at a great price, hating those damned spoils and the
      day.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>These &#x201C;spoils&#x201D; (<em>spolia</em>, 504) that for Turnus brought him such delight
      will soon cause him to regret his decision to strip Pallas&#x2019; corpse for
      plunder &#x2013; let alone kill him in the first place. The poet&#x2019;s lament for
      the inability of mortals to know the consequences of their actions here
      thus signals once again the inability of <em>monumenta</em> to maintain a
      stable meaning: the future will bring different viewers and thereby
      different interpretations to a single object &#x2013; and this makes it
      impossible for that object have a single, stable way of understanding of
      it. The epistemological boundaries of these <em>monumenta</em> are not stable,
      in other words, but are constantly being broken down, re-interpreted,
      and built back up depending on the viewer.<sup id="fnref:363"><a href="#fn:363" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>There is still at least one more very important level, however, on which
      to interpret the <em>monumenta</em> of the baldric &#x2013; one that has great
      significance for how to understand both its inability to keep in check
      the chaotic forces of the past and its instability of meaning. Vergil&#x2019;s
      phrasing is somewhat ambiguous when he describes Aeneas&#x2019; actions as the
      Trojan hero looks at the baldric. As scholars have noted, the <em>saeui
      monumenta doloris</em> (945) that he takes in through his eyes can also
      refer to the images which have been engraved on the baldric.<sup id="fnref:364"><a href="#fn:364" class="footnote">29</a></sup> The
      reader is aware of the scene depicted on the sword-belt because when
      Turnus first strips the piece of armor from the dead Pallas the poet
      enters into a brief ecphrasis on its decoration:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>&#x2026;exanimem rapiens immania pondera baltei
      impressumque nefas: una sub nocte iugali
      caesa manus iuuenum foede thalamique cruenti,
      quae Clonus Eurytides multo caelauerat auro;
      quo nunc Turnus ovat spolio gaudetque potitus. (<em>Aen</em>. 10.496-500)</p>
      
        <p>&#x2026;snatching the heavy weight of the baldric and the sin pressed upon
      it: during the course of a single wedding night a band of young men
      slain in sin and marriage chambers bloodied, which events Clonus, son
      of Eurytus, had engraved in much gold. And it is in this set of spoils
      which Turnus now rejoices and takes pleasure having obtained them.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The baldric frames the story of the Danaids who killed their husbands on
      their wedding night. Much scholarly attention has been given to the
      details of this description &#x2013; and, in particular, its relation to the
      actual monument on the Palatine in Augustan Rome mentioned above which
      presents the same myth.<sup id="fnref:365"><a href="#fn:365" class="footnote">30</a></sup> The point I want to emphasize, however, is
      that Turnus does not seem to realize that by taking up the baldric he is
      also taking up &#x201C;the sin pressed upon it&#x201D; (<em>rapiens immania pondera
      baltei</em> / <em>impressumque nefas</em>, 10.496-497). His interpretation of the
      baldric as a set of spoils (<em>spolio</em>, 500) does not see past the thick
      layer of gold (<em>multo&#x2026;auro</em>, 499) that frames &#x2013; and thus in a sense
      covers over &#x2013; the brutality of what is depicted. When Aeneas sees the
      baldric, though, he is said to &#x201C;drink in with his eyes the <em>monumenta</em>
      of the cruel grief <em>and</em> the spoils&#x201D; (cf. <em>oculis postquam saeui
      monumenta doloris</em> / <em>exuuiasque hausit</em>, 12.945-946), which suggests a
      different and more penetrating reading than seeing them only as
      <em>spolia</em>.<sup id="fnref:366"><a href="#fn:366" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Could it be that the savagery of events depicted stirs
      him to reject pity and slay the subdued Turnus?<sup id="fnref:367"><a href="#fn:367" class="footnote">32</a></sup> That is certainly
      not excluded by Vergil&#x2019;s vague wording here.<sup id="fnref:368"><a href="#fn:368" class="footnote">33</a></sup> I would suggest that
      the poet allows for a reading of the scene whereby Aeneas is himself
      reading in the violence depicted on the baldric a reminder (or
      &#x201C;monument&#x201D;) to violence which then stirs him to take Turnus&#x2019; life.<sup id="fnref:369"><a href="#fn:369" class="footnote">34</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The <em>monumenta</em> of the baldric &#x2013; whether the sword-belt itself or the
      images depicted on it &#x2013; clearly do not have one stable meaning; they
      change meaning, rather, depending on who sees them and what exactly that
      viewer sees. These several, often competing meanings cause readers to
      re-evaluate constantly the boundaries of any single interpretation. The
      baldric thus very clearly &#x201C;fails&#x201D; as a monument in two related ways. It
      cannot maintain a single meaning, on the one hand, as Turnus cannot
      control the meaning of the baldric, and Aeneas cannot see the object
      without unleashing the violence it commemorates, whether intentionally
      or not.<sup id="fnref:370"><a href="#fn:370" class="footnote">35</a></sup> By looking at the play between surface and meaning, on the
      other hand, we can see that the baldric also fails to contain the chaos
      it depicts on it resplendent, golden exterior. The artistry of the frame
      does not matter: in the <em>Aeneid</em>, at least, that which bounds the fury
      inherent to Rome&#x2019;s origins is shown as susceptible to collapse &#x2013; and
      thereby to release the chaos inside. And for that reason Aeneas&#x2019;
      violence-inducing interpretation of the baldric becomes perhaps the
      perfect way for Vergil to end his poem.<sup id="fnref:371"><a href="#fn:371" class="footnote">36</a></sup> It makes the baldric
      emblematic, I would argue, of a structure that pervades and perhaps even
      mirrors the entire poem, as the epic too fails to aestheticize in an
      unambiguous way the destruction and violent chaos of Rome&#x2019;s past within
      its beautiful, highly-wrought, &#x201C;golden&#x201D; frame.<sup id="fnref:372"><a href="#fn:372" class="footnote">37</a></sup> What remains inside
      it is not a single truth but a chaotic force &#x2013; one that not only breaks
      through the frame of the fiction that contains it to affect Aeneas but
      at the same time also reveals the fiction that any frame can safely
      contain such fury.<sup id="fnref:373"><a href="#fn:373" class="footnote">38</a></sup></p>
      
      <h3 id="part-3-reading-beneath-the-surface-of-augustan-monuments">Part 3. Reading Beneath the Surface of Augustan Monuments</h3>
      
      <p>Vergilian architexture is not so much about what a genre claims to
      exclude as what it can include &#x2013; or rather tries to contain. Certain
      chaotic forces of Rome&#x2019;s past cannot be tamed by an attempt to give them
      a facade of epic that seeks to frame those forces. This does not
      necessarily mean, however, that the poem is criticizing the grand
      monuments of the Augustan age as pure propaganda which needs to be seen
      through to the chaotic past they hide.<sup id="fnref:374"><a href="#fn:374" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Such an interpretation of
      the poem takes away from the complexity of meaning that the <em>Aeneid</em>
      highlights in dealing with monuments. The poem might suggest that there
      is something sinister lurking behind those glorious, travertine facades
      in Rome, something in the past that should not be forgotten lest it
      return to wreak havoc on the present. But it does so, I would argue, in
      order to make its readers into more effective readers of that past and
      better caretakers of their own future &#x2013; not merely to destabilize the
      meaning of the present.</p>
      
      <p>The poem helps its readers (ancient and modern) to understand more fully
      what monuments can accomplish even in their apparent &#x201C;failure.&#x201D;
      Monuments allow us, on the one hand, to move into the future without
      forgetting the mistakes we have made in the past; that is often a
      significant part of their purpose, after all, according to Fran&#xE7;oise
      Choay in her seminal study on the idea of monument in modernity.<sup id="fnref:375"><a href="#fn:375" class="footnote">40</a></sup>
      What the <em>Aeneid</em> shows us, on the other hand, is how the very failure
      of a monument to maintain a specific meaning and/or to conceal the
      horrors of the past can (paradoxically perhaps) achieve a similar
      effect: by exposing readers to such failures, by showing them the
      &#x201C;cracks&#x201D; in the facade of the epic structure, the poem is not claiming
      that monuments are useless; on the contrary, the <em>Aeneid</em> urges its
      readers through its failed architecture (and architexture) to see the
      need for understanding the flaws and limitations of such structures if
      one is to gain anything from them.</p>
      
      <p>The poem is therefore not quite demonstrating only the &#x201C;impossibility of
      dictating artistic interpretation,&#x201D; as Shadi Bartsch has
      suggested.<sup id="fnref:376"><a href="#fn:376" class="footnote">41</a></sup> Nor does it merely show the dangers of forgetting the
      past.<sup id="fnref:377"><a href="#fn:377" class="footnote">42</a></sup> The <em>Aeneid</em> should not be seen, moreover, as presenting
      only a complementary narrative to the monuments of the Augustan age
      because its &#x201C;fictional framework allows a broader perspective on Roman
      history than the propagandistic monument.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:378"><a href="#fn:378" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Vergil crafts a
      <em>monumentum</em> whose architexture can both celebrate the past and the
      future while simultaneously making its readers aware <em>through</em> its
      failure of the <em>errores</em> of that past and the chaos that could break out
      at any moment in that future.<sup id="fnref:379"><a href="#fn:379" class="footnote">44</a></sup> It is thus very similar to the
      Temple of Janus that Jupiter describes in Book 1 of the poem: the Temple
      is also a monument that celebrates the current peace not by eradicating
      the <em>furor</em> of Rome&#x2019;s past but by bounding it within its doors &#x2013; gates
      barred tightly with iron, yes, but ones which also have the potential to
      be re-opened at any moment, releasing the chaos from the past that they
      contain.</p>
      
      <p>The poem can thus even become a <em>monumentum</em> that represents in its
      &#x201C;failure&#x201D; a strategy for interpreting other monuments of the Augustan
      age, as well. Augustus was certainly not ignorant of the sorts of
      problems that accompany the use of monuments. Chapter III has already
      suggested that the <em>princeps</em> presents a highly sophisticated
      understanding of the idea of the monument in his own <em>Res Gestae</em> that
      parallels Horace&#x2019;s own complex use of the idea in the <em>Odes</em>.<sup id="fnref:380"><a href="#fn:380" class="footnote">45</a></sup> A
      similar case can be made here by examining other sections of Augustus&#x2019;
      monumental inscription about his achievements. It is noteworthy, for
      instance, to look at what Augustus has to say regarding that same Temple
      of Janus mentioned several times throughout the past two chapters:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>[Ianum] Quirin[um quem cl[laussum ess[e maiores nostri
      voluer]runt, cum [p]er totum i[mperium pop]uli Roma[ni terra
      marique es]set parta victoriis pax, cum, pr[iusquam] nascerer, [a
      condita] u[rb]e bis omnino clausum [f]uisse prodatur
      m[emori]ae, ter me princi[pe senat]us claudendum esse censui[t].
      (<em>RGDA</em> 13)</p>
      
        <p>Although before I was born it is said that the temple of Janus
      Quirinus had been closed twice since the founding of the city &#x2013; a
      temple which our ancestors wanted to be closed whenever peace had been
      won by victories through the whole empire of the Roman people on both
      land and sea &#x2013; while I was <em>princeps</em> the senate ordered that it
      should be closed three times.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>The point here is not just that Augustus has established peace more
      times during his rule alone than in all of Roman history combined. That
      is what the words say, of course. As the present study of the <em>Aeneid</em>
      has shown, however, monuments have a meaning beneath their surfaces, as
      well. Closing the doors does not mean that <em>furor</em> is gone forever; it
      is trapped, rather, and that should not be forgotten. Just as important
      as how many times Augustus has closed the doors is the fact that Rome
      has been at war for almost its entire history. <em>Furor</em> has always been a
      part of Rome&#x2019;s story &#x2013; the <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates that aspect of its
      history again and again in a time before Rome the city even existed.
      Augustus does not mention explicitly this fact but instead focuses on
      the positive: his birth signifies a new age where peace is finally
      possible.<sup id="fnref:381"><a href="#fn:381" class="footnote">46</a></sup> Again that does not mean that <em>Furor</em> has been
      eliminated, as even under Augustus&#x2019; reign the gates were closed and then
      re-opened.<sup id="fnref:382"><a href="#fn:382" class="footnote">47</a></sup> Yet it is that very acknowledgement &#x2013; that Rome could
      fall into chaos again &#x2013; which gives Augustus&#x2019; statement even more
      significance and power for his Roman readers. To close the gates so many
      times signifies a new age where peace can finally happen; the horrors of
      the past are still there, though, within the walls of the structure &#x2013; no
      matter how grand it is, no matter how tightly shut it may be &#x2013; ready to
      burst out at any moment.</p>
      
      <p>Reading Augustus&#x2019; words in this way suggests that while the <em>princeps</em>
      alone has been able to control and contain the <em>Furor</em> of Rome&#x2019;s past,
      that containment might not last forever. It is precisely because this
      situation may only be temporary, though, that Romans therefore need
      Augustus (or his successor) to continue to be their <em>princeps</em> and keep
      chained the <em>Furor</em> of their past as Romans. And so it is to the
      Augustus&#x2019; advantage as well as their own for the readers of the <em>Res
      Gestae</em> and their newly monumental city to be able to see past the
      exterior of the temple and its closed doors, to be able to imagine the
      chaos that resides inside the architectural monument, that is, at least
      for the moment.</p>
      
      <p>It is possible to detect a similar destabilization of the surface in
      other Augustan monuments. The Ara Pacis has a much greater effect on its
      audience, for instance, when rather than seen as covering over the
      horrors of the recent past of civil strife such <em>errores</em> are imagined
      to exist right below its marble surface in such a way that the glorious
      present and future can be set in relief against them.<sup id="fnref:383"><a href="#fn:383" class="footnote">48</a></sup> Peace and
      concord mean much more, after all, when set against war and conflict. No
      one should blame Augustus for not depicting the horrors of Rome&#x2019;s recent
      civil wars on Augustan monuments any more than anyone should criticize
      Daedalus for not carving his son&#x2019;s death (for which he had some
      responsibility) on the doors of the temple of Apollo.<sup id="fnref:384"><a href="#fn:384" class="footnote">49</a></sup> What the
      <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates is how to look at what is not on the surface, as
      in the case of Daedalus&#x2019; failed <em>monumenta</em>, and to see what might be
      hard to take in but which is important not to forget lest Romans make
      the same mistakes again. Even when the chaos of the past is framed
      within Augustan architecture &#x2013; as in the case of the Danaid friezes of
      his Temple of Apollo,<sup id="fnref:385"><a href="#fn:385" class="footnote">50</a></sup> or the depiction of a bound <em>Furor</em> in his
      own forum<sup id="fnref:386"><a href="#fn:386" class="footnote">51</a></sup> &#x2013; those monuments gain more importance when seen not as
      merely portrayals of triumph over chaos but as reminders that such chaos
      could break free of its frame at any moment if Romans become complacent
      in times of peace and order. The poem shows its readers a way to
      interpret <em>monumenta</em> whereby one can be aware of their magnificent
      surfaces &#x2013; of the order that they attempt to give to the events of
      history &#x2013; and at the same time can understand that such frames do not
      tell the entire story, that it is the interpreter&#x2019;s own task to inquire
      into the past, confronting head-on former <em>errores</em> and horrors of that
      past to understand how to keep them from repeating.</p>

      <p>I am not claiming that Vergil and Augustus were alone in having this
      perspective on monumental discourse of the Augustan age.<sup id="fnref:387"><a href="#fn:387" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Their
      fellow Romans could hardly turn a corner in the city without coming
      &#x201C;face to face with the visual evidence of the contradictions and
      paradoxes which underlay the imperial system,&#x201D; as the city of Rome was
      certainly &#x201C;a realm of multiple perspectives and dramatic
      collisions.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:388"><a href="#fn:388" class="footnote">53</a></sup> Nor were historians such as Livy and elegiac poets
      such as Propertius unaware of the multiplicity of meaning that is
      inherent to monuments.<sup id="fnref:389"><a href="#fn:389" class="footnote">54</a></sup> What I am suggesting are the ways that the
      <em>Aeneid</em> is further exploring an element of monumental discourse in the
      Augustan age &#x2013; one which can be found in the <em>Res Gestae</em> of Augustus
      himself &#x2013; not inventing it wholesale, but both shaping it and being
      influenced by it.</p>
      
      <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> is a text that enwraps Rome&#x2019;s past in an epic facade. It
      fails to accomplish this completely, however, letting the chaos that is
      a part of the Roman past break out at certain points in the poem,
      whether it be the winds of Aeolus or the Greeks in the Horse, whether it
      be the fury of the Trojan women on Sicily or the rage of Aeneas that
      ends the poem. It is a <em>monumentum</em> that forces its readers to focus not
      merely on what is on its surface but on what lies behind it, what past
      monsters of <em>Furor</em> exist within its boundaries. This is not because it
      seeks to undercut or &#x201C;deconstruct&#x201D; its facade &#x2013; that would be a
      simplistic way of understanding the poem&#x2019;s complex monumental
      architexture. The <em>Aeneid</em> shows its readers these &#x201C;cracks&#x201D; and allows
      them then to gain a fuller appreciation of the peaceful stability that
      Augustan monuments represent, as well as how fragile that peace can be
      should they forget what lies behind their magnificent facades.</p>
      
      <p>The <em>Aeneid</em> and its sophisticated architexture also points towards a
      development in the modern understanding of the monument during the
      twentieth century: an anxiety about what our monuments mean, or can
      mean, when we somehow have to confront the horrors of the past while
      still having hope that we can do better in our future.<sup id="fnref:390"><a href="#fn:390" class="footnote">55</a></sup> The poem
      proves, on the one hand, that this need for a double perspective is not
      just a modern phenomenon or problem. It does more, on the other hand,
      than just point to this anxiety. The <em>Aeneid</em> demonstrates to its
      readers, ancient and modern, that it is only by acknowledging the
      capacity of monumental architecture to &#x201C;fail&#x201D; that we can truly
      appreciate the service it provides for us.<sup id="fnref:391"><a href="#fn:391" class="footnote">56</a></sup> The poem does not
      destabilize the meaning(s) that we give to monuments to no end by
      showing the flaws in their epistemological foundations. It is rather by
      showing &#x201C;failure&#x201D; to be inherent to the idea of the monument that the
      <em>Aeneid</em> can demonstrate how monuments might help us come to grips with
      our past &#x2013; no matter how chaotic or full of violence &#x2013; while also having
      the belief that we can learn from our mistakes and thereby do better in
      the present and future.<sup id="fnref:392"><a href="#fn:392" class="footnote">57</a></sup></p>

      who clearly saw (<em>ad Aen.</em> 12.949) that it was <em>ultio foederis
      rupti</em> &#x2013; revenge for the breaking of the treaty, a violation of
      divine and human law for which there was no clemency in Rome. This

      Pallas who had been entrusted to him.&#x201D; In fact, Galinsky connects

      individuals, events, sacrifices, practices or beliefs. The
      specificity of the monument is therefore a direct function of the

      through the mediation of affectivity, in such a way as to recall the

      argument I am makin here (unlike Harrison&#x2019;s) is not dependent on
      whether such a work was a part of the Forum before or after the
      completion of the epic poem: Vergil is not so much discussing
      individual works of architectural detail as the very idea of what
      architectural monuments can and cannot do. <a href="#fnref:386" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>Galinsky 1996, 222, argues that &#x201C;Augustan culture was
      characterized not by frigid homogeneity, but by the existence of
      plentiful tensions and contradictions, the monarchic republic or
      republican monarchy being the prime example. [&#x2026;] Instead of
      simple and obvious &#x2018;messages,&#x2019; Augustan art (and poetry) asks for
      the intellectual participation of the viewer or reader and for their
      scrutiny of alternative interpretations in order that the intentions
      of the creators may be understood all the more thoroughly.&#x201D; <a href="#fnref:387" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 23. According to the two of them, in
      fact, &#x201C;[t]he shifting positions of spectatorship, the experience
      of &#x2018;double vision&#x2019; and the phenomenon of the visual palimpsest all
      feature prominently, amid a general interest in lack of closure and
      the contestation of meaning in this most remarkable of urban, public
      spaces,&#x201D; that is, the city Rome (9). See also Welch 2005, 23,
      suggesting that for the Romans of the Augustan age &#x201C;[t]he presence
      of Romes divergent over time thus multiplies the ways one may
      interpret Roman monuments.&#x201D; <a href="#fnref:388" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>On Propertius&#x2019; take on the idea of the monument see Welch 2005,
      19-34, where she claims that &#x201C;[t]he multiple perspectives on
      Rome&#x2019;s places offered in elegy 4.1 raise the possibility that Rome&#x2019;s
      monuments are not monolithic in their meaning, but rather mean
      different things to different people or to the same people at
      different times or in different contexts&#x201D; (34). For the way that
      Livy uses monuments in his history see Jaeger 1997, <em>passim</em>, and
      esp. 11-12: &#x201C;When monuments fail and the text restores them,
      reminders of stories give way to stories about reminders. By drawing
      attention to the [Livy&#x2019;s] reconstructive activity, the restored
      monuments [in the <em>Ab urbe condita</em>] commemorate his recollection
      of that past.&#x201D; I discuss in more detail Livy&#x2019;s &#x201C;monumental&#x201D; history,
      as well as Jaeger&#x2019;s arguments about it, in Chapter II above (pp.
      36-43). <a href="#fnref:389" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>The idea of memory itself &#x2013; like the idea of the monument &#x2013;
      cannot exist without the possibility of its failure, i.e., that one
      can forget. See Most 2001, 149, where he proposes that Vergil &#x201C;not
      only knew that human memory is constantly besieged by oblivion and
      that every effort of memory must struggle against the insistence of
      forgetfulness; he also recognized that memory even presupposes
      forgetting and depends upon it.&#x201D; <a href="#fnref:391" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

            <p>Larmour and Spencer 2007b, 55-56, suggest that a balanaced
      perspective such as this was an essential ingredient to the success
      of the Augustan age to rise out of the chaos of Rome&#x2019;s recent past,
      since &#x201C;the civil wars of the first century BCE and a material
      decline in the fabric of Rome could be represented as integral to a
      period of optimistic transformation and restoration under Augustus.&#x201D; <a href="#fnref:392" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>
