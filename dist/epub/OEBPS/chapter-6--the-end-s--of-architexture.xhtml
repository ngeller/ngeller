    <div class="chapter-body">
      <p>Horace stabilizes his architextural <em>monumentum</em> by keeping opposites in
      perfect tension through rhetorical disavowals. Vergil destabilizes the
      boundaries of his, on the other hand, by exposing what horrors of Rome&#x2019;s
      past seek to escape through the cracks in his epic facade. The
      <em>princeps</em> employed both strategies when constructing a new Rome within
      the Roman imagination; it was perhaps even imperative for him to do so
      if he was to be successful in introducing new elements to Rome&#x2019;s
      traditional structure while at the same time keeping alive the memory of
      Rome&#x2019;s rough recent history in the cultural consciousness. Although
      Augustus claimed to keep intact the traditional &#x201C;structures&#x201D; of Rome, it
      was in these very same claims &#x2013; or rather rhetorical refusals &#x2013; that he
      could perhaps best articulate the novel power he had acquired. At the
      same time, however, Augustus was also in charge of creating a new
      &#x201C;structure&#x201D; to reframe Roman existence after the &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; of the
      republic.<sup id="fnref:393"><a href="#fn:393" class="footnote">1</a></sup> And for Romans to appreciate fully Augustus&#x2019; marble city
      as a monument built upon Rome&#x2019;s past foundations the <em>princeps</em> also
      required citizens who could see beneath the city&#x2019;s newly resplendent
      surface to the ruin and chaos of its history that could just as easily
      return if completely forgotten. Augustus&#x2019; ability to perform this
      balancing act throughout his reign was thus an important part of
      reconstructing a Roman state that would last. And this dissertation has
      argued that in his <em>Res Gestae</em> Augustus relied on the discourse of
      monumentality &#x2013; like the poets of his age with their <em>monumenta</em> &#x2013; in
      order to frame his reconstruction of Rome in the imagination of his new
      subjects just as much as in its physical landscape.</p>
      
      <p>By the end of the Augustan age, however, different issues arose as the
      once stable boundaries which had structured Roman existence in the
      republic were in large part replaced by new ones under Augustus. The
      political system was different. Augustus had powers above and beyond
      what any single Roman before him had amassed. The city was different,
      too. It had undergone a transformation that was unlike anything that its
      inhabitants had witnessed before. It was a time of transition to
      something new, a time of flexibility and flux.<sup id="fnref:394"><a href="#fn:394" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Not surprisingly,
      the architexture of late Augustan poetry reflects this state of affairs.
      The <em>Metamorphoses</em> of Ovid in particular demonstrates yet another
      important element of the success that the <em>princeps</em> achieved. Ovid does
      not seek to stabilize or destabilize his architextural structure, as
      Horace and Vergil did, respectively; rather, as I argue below, the late
      Augustan poet transcends the very idea of structure in such a way that
      he can enable his Roman readers to become participants in endowing his
      structure-less monument with meaning.<sup id="fnref:395"><a href="#fn:395" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The present chapter will examine Ovid&#x2019;s poem with particular attention
      to this seemingly paradoxical idea of a structure that resists the idea
      of structure. Part 1 will analyze the poem&#x2019;s structural &#x201C;frame&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:396"><a href="#fn:396" class="footnote">4</a></sup> &#x2013;
      its difficult proem and much-debated epilogue &#x2013; in order to understand
      better the way that the monument of the <em>Metamorphoses</em> attempts to
      transcend structure, as well as what implications that has for the Roman
      reader. This close analysis of Ovid&#x2019;s transcendent poetics will set the
      stage for one last return to Augustus&#x2019; <em>Res Gestae</em> in Part 2 to see how
      the <em>princeps</em> performs his own transcendence of structure in assuming a
      comprehensive control over Roman space at the end of his own monumental
      work.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Part 1. Ovid&#x2019;s Transcendent Poetics</strong></p>
      
      <p>Horace&#x2019;s collection of <em>Odes</em> is a work of lyric poetry. Vergil&#x2019;s
      <em>Aeneid</em> is an epic. They may negotiate their places within these two
      genres, as Chapters III-V have shown, but both poets at least have a
      clear architextural model to work with/against as they present their
      poems architecturally. The situation is different when it comes to
      Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorphoses</em>. The genre of the poem has long been debated
      among scholars. To some it is &#x201C;an uncategorizable multiform prodigy&#x201D; &#x2013;
      one that purposefully defies generic classification through an extreme
      mixture of genres and modes.<sup id="fnref:397"><a href="#fn:397" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Others acknowledge epic as the &#x201C;point
      of reference for generic conflict,&#x201D; seeking then to evaluate just how
      epic the <em>Metamorphoses</em> really is.<sup id="fnref:398"><a href="#fn:398" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>The point of the present analysis will not be to provide a comprehensive
      study on the poem&#x2019;s complex meaning. Nor will it so much aim to solve
      the debate about genre as to change its parameters, that is, to look
      through the poem&#x2019;s architexture to ask why the <em>Metamorphoses</em> is so
      difficult to define in the first place. Ovid is not so much
      &#x201C;deconstructing&#x201D; the idea genre, <em>per se</em>,<sup id="fnref:399"><a href="#fn:399" class="footnote">7</a></sup> as he is staging the
      transcendence of structure itself in order to keep himself and his poem
      continually alive in the imagination of his readers. He leaves his
      structure &#x201C;open,&#x201D; in other words, so that it becomes dependent upon his
      readers themselves to give it a final sort of definition and establish
      its ultimate meaning in relation to their Roman reality.<sup id="fnref:400"><a href="#fn:400" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Before examining the architextural &#x201C;structure&#x201D; that Ovid claims to have
      built in his famous epilogue at the end of Book 15, it is important to
      understand the context in which he constructs it. And it is perhaps at
      the beginning of the poem that Ovid as the narrator most clearly sets
      the boundaries of his scope, generic and otherwise, even if those same
      boundaries hardly appear stable from the very start.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas\
      corpora; di, coeptis (nam uos mutastis et illa)\
      adspirate meis primaque ab origine mundi\
      ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen. (Ov. <em>Met</em>. 1.1-4)<sup id="fnref:401"><a href="#fn:401" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
      
        <p>My mind urges me to speak of forms changed into new bodies. Inspire my
      undertakings, gods (for you have changed those, too), and spin a
      continuous song from the very origin of the world up to my own times.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Much has been written about these four lines and their importance to the
      poem.<sup id="fnref:402"><a href="#fn:402" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Transformations from the beginning of the world to Ovid&#x2019;s
      present are the topic of the <em>Metamorphoses</em>. That much is certain. The
      more one looks at the proem, though, the less clear its meaning becomes.
      The past is Ovid&#x2019;s frame, yes, but the first two words of the poem &#x2013; <em>in
      nova</em> &#x2013; point towards something new, as scholars have stressed.<sup id="fnref:403"><a href="#fn:403" class="footnote">11</a></sup>
      And which past is it anyway? A historical one? Or one largely concerned
      with myth?<sup id="fnref:404"><a href="#fn:404" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Or both? Transformation is the focus, obviously, but
      what kind of transformation? Although the more typical way of stating
      such a theme would be to say that the poem will examine bodies changing
      their shapes, it has been noted that Ovid rather peculiarly says he will
      sing of the shapes themselves (<em>formae</em>) changing into new bodies (<em>in
      nova&#x2026;</em> / <em>corpora</em>, 1-2).<sup id="fnref:405"><a href="#fn:405" class="footnote">13</a></sup> Then there is the question of genre,
      with particular focus on the frustrating &#x201C;generic paradox&#x201D; implied in
      the juxtaposition of <em>deducite</em> and <em>perpetuum</em>&#x2026;<em>carmen</em> in line
      4.<sup id="fnref:406"><a href="#fn:406" class="footnote">14</a></sup> Whereas the former is an elegiac word, used by Vergil,
      Propertius, and Horace to describe their respective songs,<sup id="fnref:407"><a href="#fn:407" class="footnote">15</a></sup> the
      latter is an &#x201C;unmistakable&#x201D; allusion to the kind of grand epic that
      Callimachus in his elegiac <em>Aetia</em> does not write.<sup id="fnref:408"><a href="#fn:408" class="footnote">16</a></sup> On one side of
      the debate, scholars have stressed epic as the base upon which Ovid is
      innovating. According to Stephen Hinds, for instance, &#x201C;the meter, bulk
      and scope of the poem ensure that the question implied in that opening
      paradox [i.e., of <em>deducite</em> and <em>perpetuum Carmen</em>] will never be
      completely eclipsed: namely, in what sense is the <em>Metamorphoses</em> an
      epic.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:409"><a href="#fn:409" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Even if the general appearance of the poem seems epic,
      however, the first line of the proem has already informed the reader
      that appearances (<em>formae</em>) are not stable.<sup id="fnref:410"><a href="#fn:410" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Joseph Farrell has
      argued, on the other side of the spectrum, that we should see the
      different genres and modes of the poem as part of a &#x201C;dialogue,&#x201D; that is,
      as individual &#x201C;ingredients of [Ovid&#x2019;s] <em>carmen perpetuum</em>,&#x201D; which
      undermines any set authority, narrative or generic.<sup id="fnref:411"><a href="#fn:411" class="footnote">19</a></sup> From this
      viewpoint, then, epic is just one of several different modes that Ovid
      is weaving together like &#x201C;a chain of iridescent tales out of one or more
      pre-existing texts, using material from different genres.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:412"><a href="#fn:412" class="footnote">20</a></sup>
      Regardless of the particular side of the debate that one falls on,
      however, there is one notion with which most would agree: all of these
      subtle reversals within the relatively brief opening to the poem point
      to the many different ways that Ovid has purposefully fashioned &#x201C;the
      proem to the <em>Metamorphoses</em> to arouse, and then defeat the expectations
      of the reader.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:413"><a href="#fn:413" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This immediate frustration of expectation at several different levels
      should not be entirely unexpected, though, given that change is the very
      topic of the poem itself. Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorphoses</em> proclaims from the
      start that change is and has always been happening, a sort of &#x201C;endless
      flux&#x201D; in the cosmos,<sup id="fnref:414"><a href="#fn:414" class="footnote">22</a></sup> all the way &#x201C;from the very origin of the
      world up to [his own] times&#x201D; (<em>primaque ab origine mundi</em> / <em>ad nostra
      tempora</em>, 3-4).<sup id="fnref:415"><a href="#fn:415" class="footnote">23</a></sup> One might then say that the base assumption of the
      proem is that change is the only constant &#x2013; even for Ovid&#x2019;s own
      undertakings themselves (cf. <em>nam uos mutastis et illa</em>, 2). Yet that is
      an assumption which cannot but prompt reflections upon the nature of
      change itself. For if change is truly a constant, then logically even
      the parameters by which we evaluate change must themselves change.<sup id="fnref:416"><a href="#fn:416" class="footnote">24</a></sup>
      And sure enough, as scholars have noted, the proem of the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em> serves as a perfect foundation for the rest of a poem
      whose very hermeneutical boundaries are constantly changing &#x2013; a &#x201C;poetics
      of flux,&#x201D; as Stephen Wheeler puts it.<sup id="fnref:417"><a href="#fn:417" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>&#x201C;The whole <em>Metamorphoses</em> is built around precisely the crossing of
      boundaries,&#x201D; Don Fowler writes, &#x201C;but it presupposes that those
      boundaries are there to be crossed.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:418"><a href="#fn:418" class="footnote">26</a></sup> The proem helps to make that
      tension explicit: in a world of constant change the short opening of the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em> introduces the idea of a generic structure without a
      stable framework &#x2013; one whose boundaries indeed seem to be established
      only to be transgressed. The <em>Metamorphoses</em> is a poem, after all, whose
      narrative is itself in a constant state of flux: stories cross over the
      &#x201C;boundaries&#x201D; of the poem&#x2019;s books,<sup id="fnref:419"><a href="#fn:419" class="footnote">27</a></sup> or are often embedded within
      others stories,<sup id="fnref:420"><a href="#fn:420" class="footnote">28</a></sup> as narrators narrate the tales of other
      narrators.<sup id="fnref:421"><a href="#fn:421" class="footnote">29</a></sup> It is no coincidence, then, that the &#x201C;boundaries&#x201D; of
      the poem&#x2019;s primary architextural image examined below are much less
      stable than even those in Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em>. The epilogue of the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em> not only reveals how Ovid&#x2019;s &#x201C;monument&#x201D; is emblematic of
      a poem without a stable generic structure; more importantly, the poem&#x2019;s
      concluding architextural image helps to illustrate how the poet
      transcends the very idea of structure inherent to monuments in order to
      reshape the boundaries of the real world, as well as his place in
      it.<sup id="fnref:422"><a href="#fn:422" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>
      
      <p><em>Iamque opus exegi</em>. &#x201C;And now I have completed my work.&#x201D; With these
      words Ovid begins the epilogue to his poem of roughly 12,000 lines. This
      is not exactly a traditionally epic ending to a poem that might seem
      epic to judge by its length.<sup id="fnref:423"><a href="#fn:423" class="footnote">31</a></sup> That should not necessarily be a
      surprise, though, given the poem&#x2019;s generic puzzles as presented in the
      proem. Although Ovid is also in dialogue with Vergil&#x2019;s <em>Aeneid</em>
      here,<sup id="fnref:424"><a href="#fn:424" class="footnote">32</a></sup> these three opening words are clearly alluding to Horace&#x2019;s
      <em>exegi monumentum</em>, that is, the phrase which begins the finale to
      Horace&#x2019;s first collection of <em>Odes</em> examined above in Chapter III.<sup id="fnref:425"><a href="#fn:425" class="footnote">33</a></sup>
      It is in the differences between how the two poets envision the
      architexture of their respective works, however, that one can best
      appreciate the striking nature of what Ovid is attempting to do in what
      is considered by many as a sort of personal <em>sphragis</em>,<sup id="fnref:426"><a href="#fn:426" class="footnote">34</a></sup> or &#x201C;seal,&#x201D;
      for his lengthy poem:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Iamque opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira nec ignis\
      nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere uetustas.\
      cum uolet, illa dies, quae nil nisi corporis huius\
      ius habet, incerti spatium mihi finiat aeui:\
      parte tamen meliore mei super alta perennis&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;875\
      astra ferar, nomenque erit indelebile nostrum;\
      quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris\
      ore legar populi, perque omnia saecula fama\
      (si quid habent ueri uatum praesagia) uiuam. (Ov. <em>Met</em>. 15.871-879)</p>
      
        <p>And now I have completed a work, which neither the wrath of Jove nor
      fire nor a sword nor decaying old age will be able to efface. May that
      day which has power over nothing except this body of mine end the
      uncertain span of my life when it wants to end it. I will forever be
      carried by the better part of me above the lofty stars, and my name
      will be indelible; wherever Roman power spreads in lands subdued, I
      will be read by the mouths of the people, and because of my fame
      through all the centuries (if the prophecies of bards have any truth)
      I shall live.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Even if Ovid is adopting the <em>exegi</em> of Horace (<em>C</em>. 3.30.1), he calls
      his work an <em>opus</em> as opposed to Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em>. Tony Woodman
      sees this as a flaw in Ovid&#x2019;s exposition, since the poet &#x201C;does not
      specify what he imagines his immortal construction to be, <em>opus</em> being a
      weak word commonly used of any literary composition.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:427"><a href="#fn:427" class="footnote">35</a></sup> According to
      Bronwen Wickkiser, on the other hand, <em>opus</em> actually &#x201C;reinforces the
      architectural metaphor&#x201D; that is more explicit in Horace&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em>;
      in fact, drawing upon the works of Vitruvius and Ovid himself, Wickkiser
      argues that &#x201C;<em>opus</em> refers especially to works of public architecture,&#x201D;
      such as monuments.<sup id="fnref:428"><a href="#fn:428" class="footnote">36</a></sup> Both scholars are right to a degree. The image
      does have an architectural valence &#x2013; both in its own right and by virtue
      of its connection to the Horatian intertext &#x2013; though it may not be as
      strong as Wickkiser suggests. For one, as Wickkiser herself points out,
      &#x201C;[t]he word <em>opus</em> occurs many times throughout the <em>Metamorphoses</em>,
      and often in reference to non-architectural works of art, such as the
      weavings of Minerva (6.82) and Arachne (6.14, 102, 130) and Pygmalion&#x2019;s
      statue (10.249, 254).&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:429"><a href="#fn:429" class="footnote">37</a></sup> There is a bit of ambiguity, in other
      words, in the term <em>opus</em> within Ovid&#x2019;s own work with respect to what
      kind of image is evoked. And it is not an insignificant choice on the
      part of the poet to avoid an unambiguously architectural image. Woodman
      is certainly correct, after all, that Ovid&#x2019;s image does lack the
      specificity of Horace&#x2019;s very architectural and physical <em>monumentum</em> &#x2013;
      and he justly prompts us to ask what exactly Ovid is envisioning here.
      For instance, would the sturdy monument of Horace be disturbed in the
      slightest by a mere &#x201C;sword&#x201D; (<em>ferrum</em>)?<sup id="fnref:430"><a href="#fn:430" class="footnote">38</a></sup> Probably not. However,
      even though Woodman (somewhat pejoratively) calls Ovid&#x2019;s <em>opus</em> an
      &#x201C;imagistic fragmentation&#x201D; for these very reasons,<sup id="fnref:431"><a href="#fn:431" class="footnote">39</a></sup> the fluid nature
      of the poem as discussed above suggests that perhaps &#x201C;imagistic
      fragmentation&#x201D; is <em>exactly</em> what Ovid is trying to achieve.</p>
      
      <p>Joseph Solodow in his monograph on the complexities of narration in the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em> presents an argument that takes a more moderate path
      between Woodman and Wickkiser in redeeming Ovid&#x2019;s lack of specificity in
      the <em>sphragis</em> of the poem. While Solodow agrees with Woodman both that
      Ovid &#x201C;presents a more abstract notion&#x201D; than Horace with the word <em>opus</em>
      and that the threats to his imagined work (i.e., the lightning bolt, the
      sword, time) &#x201C;evoke no one particular image,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:432"><a href="#fn:432" class="footnote">40</a></sup> the former scholar
      sees this &#x201C;fragmentation&#x201D; not as a flaw but rather as part of Ovid&#x2019;s
      &#x201C;triumph&#x201D; over Horace; for Solodow, in fact, &#x201C;Ovid&#x2019;s claim is grander&#x201D;
      than that of his predecessor, even if it is less &#x201C;epic.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:433"><a href="#fn:433" class="footnote">41</a></sup> His
      reasoning here has to do with the notion that Ovid&#x2019;s <em>opus</em> is &#x201C;in every
      point more private.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:434"><a href="#fn:434" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Unlike Horace&#x2019; account &#x2013; whose massive
      <em>monumentum</em> is &#x201C;objective, nearly impersonal,&#x201D; striving for a sort of
      epic grandeur despite its lyric mode &#x2013; Ovid&#x2019;s accomplishment &#x201C;originates
      in him, its sphere is himself, the glory that results will be his
      alone.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:435"><a href="#fn:435" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Ovid wants his readers to see him as an artist, according
      to Solodow, and his final words help establish the poet as the sole
      creator of the world inside his poem.<sup id="fnref:436"><a href="#fn:436" class="footnote">44</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>Solodow is right to see the abstract image of Ovid&#x2019;s <em>opus</em> as symbolic
      for a poem that &#x201C;strives for visible clarity and for the public and
      permanent qualities of a monument&#x2026;[a]nd yet at the same time&#x2026;remains a
      feat of triumphant subjectivity.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:437"><a href="#fn:437" class="footnote">45</a></sup> And there is something more
      &#x201C;private&#x201D; about Ovid&#x2019;s apparent farewell than Horace&#x2019;s grander and more
      solemn send-off. It would seem, however, that Solodow goes too far in
      claiming that &#x201C;[n]either the poet nor his poem claims to speak for
      anything larger than the individual, not divinity or national life, not
      history or society.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:438"><a href="#fn:438" class="footnote">46</a></sup> In contrast to this view, Wickkiser is not
      incorrect to stress the importance of the historical &#x2013; and, in
      particular, architectural &#x2013; context in which Ovid was writing. Although
      Ovid&#x2019;s architextural image might be more difficult to determine, as
      Woodman suggests, and his tone perhaps more subjective and personal, as
      Solodow is right to point out, the poet is still working within the
      architectural discourse of his age. It is in fact the very idea of
      structure inherent to monumentality which Ovid is aiming to transcend
      while simultaneously also employing it.<sup id="fnref:439"><a href="#fn:439" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>
      
      <p>This is perhaps not a simple idea to grasp. How one can both use and
      abuse the metaphor of structure at the same time? Let us start unpacking
      this concept by looking first at the poet himself and the relationship
      he has with his monument. For one, it is not Ovid&#x2019;s <em>monumentum</em> that
      will defy time and space, as Horace&#x2019;s did, so much as the poet
      himself<sup id="fnref:440"><a href="#fn:440" class="footnote">48</a></sup> &#x2013; albeit not in his current mortal form. Time has control
      over Ovid&#x2019;s body, yes, but nothing more than that: <em>dies, quae nil nisi
      corporis huius</em> / <em>ius habet</em> (874-875). Time also has the ability to
      &#x201C;end the space of [his] life&#x201D; (<em>spatium mihi finiat aevi</em>, 875). Yet
      Ovid will not be bound by a physical space anymore, either, as he will
      be carried not just <em>to</em> the stars, but all the way <em>beyond</em> them (cf.
      <em>super&#x2026;astra ferar</em>, 875-876).<sup id="fnref:441"><a href="#fn:441" class="footnote">49</a></sup> Chapter II demonstrated the way in
      which monuments have the ability to make past time and space
      present.<sup id="fnref:442"><a href="#fn:442" class="footnote">50</a></sup> One could argue that Ovid here is calling to mind the
      very time and space that monuments help to manifest only to transcend
      them as the material version of the poet himself disappears and a
      version of his self is kept alive &#x201C;forever&#x201D; (cf. <em>perennis</em>, 875) in the
      imagination of the Roman people. In order to transcend structure, after
      all, one needs to have a structure to transcend &#x2013; and it is precisely
      this which the idea of the monument provides for Ovid here.</p>
      
      <p>It is not just that Ovid transcends structure, however, but the precise
      way in which he does that is so essential to understanding the broader
      implications of his work for the world outside it. Ovid might be more
      &#x201C;private&#x201D; in his send-off, as Solodow suggests, but he has made that
      &#x201C;private&#x201D; part of him a public object through his poem, as well. Indeed,
      as Ovid himself claims, his &#x201C;better part&#x201D; (<em>parte meliore</em>, 875) will no
      longer be just his own. Every Roman citizen wherever Roman power has
      spread (cf. <em>quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris</em>, 877) will
      contribute to making Ovid&#x2019;s prophecy of immortality (cf. <em>vivam</em>, 879)
      come true precisely because the poet will now be read by all Romans (cf.
      <em>ore legar populi</em>, 878). Even if Ovid&#x2019;s body (<em>corporis</em>, 874) might
      die and rot and disintegrate, the Romans themselves will nevertheless
      ensure that his name becomes indestructible (cf. <em>nomenque erit
      indelebile nostrum</em>, 876). Ovid&#x2019;s poem is his own. The <em>sphragis</em> makes
      that clear. It is through a transition into the public realm, though,
      that poem and poet can achieve a sort of immortality that is granted to
      an existence without firm physical boundaries of time and space.</p>
      
      <p>Yet this transcendence is about more than mere &#x201C;textual survival.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:443"><a href="#fn:443" class="footnote">51</a></sup>
      If the conclusion to the poem shows how the private has become public in
      Ovid&#x2019;s world, the poem itself also shows conversely how the public has
      become private. The poet is telling not only his own story in the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em>, as Horace does for the most part in his <em>Odes</em>; Ovid is
      relating, rather, all the changes that have ever happened from the
      beginning of the world to his own time in leading to Rome&#x2019;s current
      position as a world power &#x2013; which is an extension, backwards and
      forwards, of even what Vergil had done in his epic poem in telling only
      of Rome&#x2019;s origins.<sup id="fnref:444"><a href="#fn:444" class="footnote">52</a></sup> More lyric than lyric, more epic than epic,
      Ovid&#x2019;s claim for comprehensiveness means that anything and anyone that
      exists or has existed in the Roman world &#x2013; mythical and historical &#x2013; is
      subject to his reinterpretation in the world of his poem.<sup id="fnref:445"><a href="#fn:445" class="footnote">53</a></sup> It is
      not simply, then, that the Romans will make Ovid eternal. By authorizing
      the poet and his world through the act of reading itself the poem&#x2019;s
      audience also brings into being a distinctive sense of what it means to
      be Roman &#x2013; one which is defined by Ovid&#x2019;s worldview,<sup id="fnref:446"><a href="#fn:446" class="footnote">54</a></sup> that is, one
      which is without firm bounds, one which &#x201C;lies open&#x201D; (<em>patet</em>,
      877).<sup id="fnref:447"><a href="#fn:447" class="footnote">55</a></sup> They can thus establish their common public identity by
      reading the monument that Ovid erects despite &#x2013; or rather <em>because of</em> &#x2013;
      the fact that they themselves give it a final structure and meaning by
      reading and interpreting the poem.</p>
      
      <p>By crafting his poem as a monument whose seemingly epic structure is
      transcended in his ambiguous architextural image at its conclusion Ovid
      can therefore leave his poem &#x201C;open&#x201D; for the reader to give it shape. Is
      it epic? Is it something else? If the former, can I even trust it? And
      ultimately what does it mean to me and my place in Roman history? Ovid&#x2019;s
      <em>monumentum</em> has a monumentality of the highest degree, perhaps, because
      it continuously prompts its readers to question the very significance of
      the history that it tells &#x2013; that is, their own history &#x2013; which thereby
      forces them to come to terms with it.<sup id="fnref:448"><a href="#fn:448" class="footnote">56</a></sup> And by thus giving a final
      shape to the poem and its author they have granted Ovid access to the
      public consciousness in such a way as to shape (as he has so much else
      in his poem) how his readers see their constantly changing world and
      their place in it.</p>
      
      <p>This sort of tension in a text between being at once left &#x201C;open&#x201D; by the
      author and &#x201C;closed&#x201D; by the reader was famously worked out by the
      twentieth-century semiotician Umberto Eco in his influential essay on
      &#x201C;The Poetics of the Open Work&#x201D; (<em>La poetica dell&#x2019;opera aperta</em>). Eco
      understood any &#x201C;work of art&#x201D; as a</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>complete form and <em>closed</em> in its perfection as a perfectly calibrated
      organic whole [which] is also <em>open</em> because of the possibility of
      being interpreted in a thousand different ways without a resulting
      change in its irreproducible uniqueness.<sup id="fnref:449"><a href="#fn:449" class="footnote">57</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>It is Eco&#x2019;s contention that a full awareness of this tension is a
      peculiarly modern phenomenon, perhaps originating in the &#x201C;open form&#x201D;
      (<em>forma aperta</em>) of baroque architecture.<sup id="fnref:450"><a href="#fn:450" class="footnote">58</a></sup> &#x201C;Rather than suffer this
      &#x2018;openness&#x2019; as an unavoidable fact,&#x201D; Eco claims, the modern poet in
      particular &#x201C;enters it into a productive program, and indeed renders it
      so as to foster in it the maximum possible number of &#x2018;openings&#x2019;.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:451"><a href="#fn:451" class="footnote">59</a></sup>
      What Ovid is doing at the end of his poem is even more complex, however.
      He gives the reader the opportunity to help construct the architextural
      monument of his poem by leaving its imaginary structure open. This is
      not to point to a sort of epistemological nihilism,<sup id="fnref:452"><a href="#fn:452" class="footnote">60</a></sup> nor to serve
      merely as a sort of intellectual game; rather, on the contrary, the
      poet&#x2019;s narrative technique makes the reader a part of the &#x201C;building&#x201D;
      process itself &#x2013; and thereby gives the reader a stake in what Ovid has
      to say about his or her identity. Ovid does this all throughout the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em>, of course, as he forces the reader again and again to
      make decisions about the poem&#x2019;s many ambiguities.<sup id="fnref:453"><a href="#fn:453" class="footnote">61</a></sup> What the
      conclusion does is to present a symbol for this process through Ovid&#x2019;s
      own transcendence of the very structure that represents his poem,
      namely, his architextural <em>opus</em>.</p>
      
      <p>To be a Roman in the Augustan age meant in part being able to read the
      new structure of the metaphorical Roman state through the physical
      landscape of the city itself. The ways in which Augustus himself
      renegotiated the space of the city were grand and impressive to the eye
      &#x2013; but at the same time could be rather subtle and nuanced in the
      language that he used to describe them. As this dissertation has shown,
      in fact, for Augustus&#x2019; message to be appreciated fully the <em>princeps</em>
      needed readers of his Rome who could interpret the often subtle
      architectural gestures that he made whether in stone or in word. In
      turning now to the <em>Res Gestae</em> for a final time, it will be possible to
      see how Augustus also ends his own account of his monumentalization of
      Rome by transcending the very boundaries of the structures that he
      erected. In a similar way to Ovid&#x2019;s poem, I argue, the conclusion of the
      inscription allows its author to assume a power that blurs private and
      public to such an extent that the boundaries themselves could be
      radically reconstructed and even become temporarily unbound. Even more
      importantly, though, Augustus&#x2019; Rome is shown to be a provisionally open
      structure just like that of Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorphoses</em> &#x2013; and one that
      likewise needed the participation of the Roman people if it was to
      achieve an enduring stability after the physical passing of its
      builder.<sup id="fnref:454"><a href="#fn:454" class="footnote">62</a></sup></p>
      
      <p><strong>Part 2. Augustus&#x2019; Reconstruction of Roman Space</strong></p>
      
      <p>&#x201C;I am leaving behind a city of marble, which I received as a city of
      brick.&#x201D; In the <em>Res Gestae</em> the change that Roman space undergoes is
      importantly not articulated through such an easy and explicit
      architectural metaphor &#x2013; as it is, for instance, in Vitruvius&#x2019;
      preface,<sup id="fnref:455"><a href="#fn:455" class="footnote">63</a></sup> or for that matter in the above boast of Augustus as
      recorded in Suetonius.<sup id="fnref:456"><a href="#fn:456" class="footnote">64</a></sup> As previous chapters have demonstrated, the
      <em>princeps</em> uses architecture in the text to articulate this
      metamorphosis of the city in much more subtle ways, too. This is no
      different when one turns to very end of the <em>Res Gestae</em>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>tertium dec[i]mum consulatu[m cum gereba]m, sena[tus et
      e]quester ordo populusq[ue] Romanus universus <strong>[appell]av[it me
      p]atr[em p]atriae</strong>, idque <strong>in vestibu[lo a]edium mearum
      inscribendum</strong> et <strong>in c[u]ria [Iulia</strong> e]t <strong>in foro

        <p>When I was consul for the thirteenth time, the senate, the equestrian
      order, and the Roman people in full agreement <strong>gave me</strong> <strong>the title
      of <em>pater patriae</em></strong>, and decreed that it should be inscribed <strong>in the
      vestibule of my house</strong> and <strong>in the Curia Julia</strong> and <strong>in the Forum
      of Augustus</strong>&#x2026; When I wrote down these accomplishments of mine I was
      seventy-seven years old.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Here at the conclusion of the account of his accomplishments Augustus
      lists three structures in which an inscription was placed proclaiming
      him as <em>pater patriae</em> (&#x201C;father of the fatherland&#x201D;): first, in the
      vestibule of his house (<em>in vestibulo aedium</em>); then, in the Curia Julia
      (<em>in Curia Iulia</em>); and, finally, in his own forum (<em>in foro Augusto</em>).
      As impressive as these structures might be (especially the forum),<sup id="fnref:457"><a href="#fn:457" class="footnote">65</a></sup>
      this list is not just another statement of what Augustus has built in
      Rome. He had already covered that topic sufficiently in paragraphs 19-21
      of the <em>RGDA</em> that were discussed above in Chapter III.<sup id="fnref:458"><a href="#fn:458" class="footnote">66</a></sup> Much more
      than a simple enumeration of structures Augustus is instead offering
      here a final statement through his building enterprise of how he has
      reconstructed the state during his reign. One might even say that the
      <em>princeps</em> is saving his most revealing statement for last &#x2013; not by
      calling attention to these buildings as physical structures so much as
      in the way that he has reconfigured the metaphorical boundaries that
      exist between them. In short, Augustus uses his farewell &#x2013; like the poet
      Ovid &#x2013; to demonstrate how he too has transcended the symbolic boundaries
      of the edifices he &#x201C;completed.&#x201D;</p>
      
      <p><br/></p>

      <p><strong>Arch of Augustus (Rimini, Italy)</strong></p>
      
      <p><br/></p>
      
      <p>Scholars have not entirely overlooked the way that Augustus uses the
      trinity of his own home, his new senate house, and his innovative forum
      to stress the creation of a new structure for the state that breaks down
      the symbolic boundaries of private and public which existed between the
      three forms. Both Edwin Ramage and Kristina Milnor argue that the frame
      of the <em>Res Gestae</em> neatly encapsulates the transformation of Augustus
      from a <em>privatus</em> citizen at the beginning to a &#x201C;transcendent public
      figure&#x201D; by its end through the triple inscription of <em>pater
      patriae</em><sup id="fnref:459"><a href="#fn:459" class="footnote">67</a></sup> &#x2013; though they differ on what exactly these spaces
      represent. Whereas Ramage sees Augustus &#x201C;go[ing] out of his way to
      underline the religious, civil, and military applications of the title
      when he points out it was to be displayed in three places,&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:460"><a href="#fn:460" class="footnote">68</a></sup> Milnor
      suggests that Augustus&#x2019; inclusion of his house here is not meant to
      invoke a religious significance (as Ramage argues) so much as to extend
      the meaning of <em>pater patriae</em> to the &#x201C;private or domestic&#x201D; aspect of
      Roman life.<sup id="fnref:461"><a href="#fn:461" class="footnote">69</a></sup> Although Milnor is likely correct to understand the
      inscription&#x2019;s placement in the house as blurring the boundaries of
      private and public, she follows Ramage&#x2019;s reading of the <em>Forum Augustum</em>
      here as merely a marker of Augustus&#x2019; power over the military. As I argue
      below, however, it is the forum (together with what it symbolizes) that
      has a rather important role for Augustus in how it allows him to open up
      the boundaries of Roman space.</p>
      
      <p>Before I discuss the forum, though, it is important first to consider
      the meaning of the other two structures and their relationship to each
      other in the text. It is not simply the work that Augustus did in
      completing the new <em>Curia Julia</em> which is the point here so much as the
      idea of the <em>curia</em> itself as a symbolic structure &#x2013; one that has in a
      sense now become a part of Augustus&#x2019; own house.<sup id="fnref:462"><a href="#fn:462" class="footnote">70</a></sup> The <em>curia</em>
      represented the old &#x201C;structure&#x201D; of power.<sup id="fnref:463"><a href="#fn:463" class="footnote">71</a></sup> It was the location
      where the &#x201C;fathers&#x201D; (<em>patres conscripti</em>) of the aristocracy deliberated
      about the Roman state. Under Augustus, however, the <em>curia</em> now had a
      new head of the Roman household: the <em>pater patriae</em> himself.<sup id="fnref:464"><a href="#fn:464" class="footnote">72</a></sup> When
      juxtaposed so closely with the same inscription placed in Augustus&#x2019; own
      house the significance of the words as inscribed on the <em>curia</em> becomes
      even clearer: the twin inscriptions illustrate how Augustus has
      reconfigured private and public in such a way as to blur the boundaries
      of the categories,<sup id="fnref:465"><a href="#fn:465" class="footnote">73</a></sup> as his house and the old home of the Roman
      &#x201C;fathers&#x201D; become joined through the words of the inscription &#x2013; as well
      as their placement next to each other here in the <em>Res Gestae</em> itself.</p>
      
      <p>The addition of a third inscription in Augustus&#x2019; own forum complicates
      this equation even further. As he does with the senate house, Augustus
      is not inserting his forum into the <em>Res Gestae</em> at this point simply to
      boast that he built it. The point is rather that the inscription
      connects this new structure to the architectural seats of power from
      both Rome&#x2019;s past and present, in the <em>curia</em> and in his own house,
      respectively. Augustus is adding still more meaning here, though,
      because of how he had set a very specific narrative of Roman history
      within his forum in a way akin to what Ovid accomplished in his
      <em>Metamorphoses</em>.<sup id="fnref:466"><a href="#fn:466" class="footnote">74</a></sup> According to Suetonius, Augustus set the statues
      of Rome&#x2019;s great men within two colonnades of his forum and added the
      proclamation:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>commentum id se, ut ad illorum vitam velut ad exemplar et ipse, dum
      viveret, et insequentium aetatium principes exigerentur a civibus.
      (<em>Div.</em> <em>Aug</em>. 31.5)</p>
      
        <p>I&#xA0;have done this so that both I myself, while alive, and the leaders
      of following ages may be compelled by the citizens to [take] the
      life of those [men of old] as an example.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>By lining the heroes of Rome&#x2019;s past within the space that bears his name
      Augustus could structure a version of Roman history that was able to
      provide a new frame for Roman identity after years of disunity and civil
      discord.<sup id="fnref:467"><a href="#fn:467" class="footnote">75</a></sup> And by taking upon himself such a task Augustus thus
      incorporated a very public structure into his own personal space. &#x201C;In
      effect,&#x201D; as Diane Favro suggests, &#x201C;the opulent Forum Augustum assumed
      the position of atrium for the State, replete with representations of
      revered ancestors.&#x201D;<sup id="fnref:468"><a href="#fn:468" class="footnote">76</a></sup> Just as with the <em>Cura Julia</em>, then, Augustus
      as <em>pater patriae</em> could create a structure through his own forum that
      blurs the boundaries between private and public. What now counted as
      Augustus&#x2019; &#x201C;house&#x201D; went far beyond its physical boundaries.</p>
      
      <p>However, just as for Ovid&#x2019;s structure in his <em>Metamorphoses</em>, if this
      opening up of boundaries is to have some definition in reality, Augustus
      needed to have the participation of the Roman citizens to give it a
      sense of closure, particularly the elite whose opportunity for display
      had become limited under Augustus.<sup id="fnref:469"><a href="#fn:469" class="footnote">77</a></sup> As the <em>princeps</em> himself
      suggests in the above proclamation, the people of Rome are indeed the
      judges; they are the ones, that is, who must ground in reality the sense
      of Roman identity that Augustus&#x2019; monuments generate and who will
      validate that narrative by compelling their leaders to follow it (cf.
      <em>principes exigerentur a civibus</em>, <em>Div.</em> <em>Aug</em>. 31.5). By thus claiming
      to have the same inscription of <em>pater patriae</em> posted in his forum as
      in his house and his senate Augustus could emphatically introduce this
      new structure and frame for Roman identity as a counterpart to the
      structures that had shaped Roman space, private and public, in the
      republic during its rise to prominence.</p>
      
      <p>Reporting these three inscriptions in close juxtaposition at the very
      conclusion of his <em>Res Gestae</em> therefore represents another way that the
      <em>princeps</em> could articulate his essentially limitless power through the
      physical structures he had established. He is not stressing their
      innovative physical nature here, or their magnificence for that matter;
      the <em>princeps</em> uses these architectural monuments, rather, in order to
      present a new structure of the state &#x2013; one in which Augustus becomes the
      <em>paterfamilias</em> of Rome itself, that is, not only of his family in his
      home, but also of the senate in the <em>curia</em>, and even of all Romans
      past, present, and future in his own forum. Although he lists these
      important &#x201C;structures,&#x201D; the conclusion to his <em>Res Gestae</em> stresses how
      Augustus has opened Roman space up in such a way that he now had a power
      which transcended the traditional limits of Rome&#x2019;s structure itself &#x2013;
      and could thereby create a new one which would endure for

      <p>The end of his monumental text is not an end for Augustus, though, just
      as the conclusion of Ovid&#x2019;s monumental <em>Metamorphoses</em> is not the end
      for the poet. Both poet and <em>princeps</em> transcend their physical, private
      bodies to become something that can live on after death, something
      forever alive, something immortal.<sup id="fnref:471"><a href="#fn:471" class="footnote">79</a></sup> They both accomplish this by
      concluding their works with architectural structures while
      simultaneously opening them up in such a way as to invite the reader to
      ground in reality the narratives that the monuments create. It is on the
      reader to close the work and stabilize the structure, even a structure
      whose boundaries are far from firm. It was not so much a god, one might
      then say, as the Roman people themselves who ultimately granted that
      Augustus&#x2019; domain become an <em>imperium sine fine</em>, &#x201C;empire without end&#x201D;
      (Verg. <em>Aen</em>. 1.279) &#x2013; both metaphorically within the city itself as
      much as physically in the provinces.</p>
      
      <p>Chapter II demonstrated how the Romans read their world architecturally.
      In the decades of civil strife before Augustus came to power, however,
      their faith in monuments to give stable meaning to their existence had
      begun to falter, at least as it is presented in the works of writers
      such as Livy and Horace examined above.<sup id="fnref:472"><a href="#fn:472" class="footnote">80</a></sup> In his project of
      monumentalizing Rome, both the city and the idea, Augustus had to
      restore the ability of monuments to help frame his subjects&#x2019; sense of
      themselves as Romans in a new age. This was not as simple as merely
      rebuilding the city more majestically and renovating its collapsed
      public structures. The idea of the monument had to change, as well, in
      order to allow for a redefinition of Roman identity that would both be
      accepted in alignment with Rome&#x2019;s past and then also endure into its
      future. Whereas Vitruvius is relatively explicit in describing how
      Augustus has transformed the state (both physically and metaphorically)
      through his monumental architecture,<sup id="fnref:473"><a href="#fn:473" class="footnote">81</a></sup> Augustus&#x2019; architectural
      discourse is more nuanced and thus enables him to articulate his own
      very careful construction of Rome as one built anew but still upon the
      foundations of Rome&#x2019;s past <em>constitutio</em>. Although he did make Rome
      grand through his monumental building projects, as Vitruvius is correct
      to claim, the <em>princeps</em> also takes up the republican charge of making
      sure that the structure of the <em>res publica</em> was not diminished.<sup id="fnref:474"><a href="#fn:474" class="footnote">82</a></sup>
      His building program &#x2013; however great in reality &#x2013; is described
      accordingly in a way that downplays his <em>physical</em> construction of
      anything conspicuously new or out of line with Roman tradition lest it
      suggest an explicit change to the metaphorical state, too. (No Mausoleum
      of Augustus to be found in this inscription.) Augustus might have
      rebuilt Rome as a city of marble, he might even have completely altered
      the <em>constitutio</em> of the <em>res publica</em> itself, but one will not find
      such talk in the <em>Res Gestae</em> because Augustus takes care in his use of
      architectural language when presenting his literal and metaphorical
      construction of the state. As this dissertation has demonstrated,
      however, the way that the <em>princeps</em> does articulate the changes he
      brought about to the structure of the state throughout his monumental
      inscription does still put stress on his architectural projects &#x2013; real
      and metaphorical &#x2013; even if Augustus uses them ultimately to stage his
      own transcendence of the traditional boundaries between the public and
      private spheres of Rome&#x2019;s past.</p>
      
      <p>The Roman poets of the Augustan age opened up and examined the
      flexibility of monuments in a way that reflected an awareness of the
      advantages and disadvantages of monumentality. They helped to create
      readers who not only could read the monuments around them, but were also
      able to interpret them actively as a part of the reconstruction of Rome
      in their imaginations. This was not just a hermeneutical game. It was
      absolutely critical if Augustus was to establish a new Rome upon the
      foundations of the past one. The &#x201C;deconstruction&#x201D; of the monument as a
      stable epistemological unit was not the goal; rather, it was the
      <em>reconstruction</em> of the idea of the monument &#x2013; and of Rome itself &#x2013;
      along lines that engaged Romans in the process.</p>

            <p>The idea of a text as simultaneously &#x201C;open&#x201D; and &#x201C;closed&#x201D; as put
      forth by Eco 1962 [1976] has been very influential for my
      interpretation of the poem as such. Eco thinks an awareness of this
      understanding of art is modern, claiming that &#x201C;certainly an artist
      of a few centuries ago was far from being intellectually aware of
      this fact&#x201D; (<em>certamente un artista di qualche secolo fa era assai
      lontano dall&#x2019;essere criticamente cosciente di questa realit&#xE0;</em>, 36).
      That seems unfair to what Ovid is doing in his <em>Metamorphoses</em>. As I
      will discuss below, pp, 177-179, his poem addresses the issue of
      &#x201C;open&#x201D; and &#x201C;closed&#x201D; in a more nuanced manner than Eco&#x2019;s conception
      of the idea initially allows for. See also Roberts, Dunn, and Fowler
      1997, which contains several essays on the theme of &#x201C;closure&#x201D; (or
      the lack thereof) in Greek and Roman literature, including Barchiesi
      1997, 184-200, presenting an analysis of the end of the
      <em>Metamorphoses</em> in this light. The transcendence of structure
      suggests not merely a lack of closure, however, but rather the

      that of Hercules, Aeneas and the Caesars: the god-favored heroes of

      <em>Metamorphoses</em> &#x2013; and it is that more humanistic perspective,

            <p>I am not the first to suggest that the kind of participation
      required by the reader in the <em>Metamophoses</em> has parallels to the
      kinds of mental tasks which faced a Roman in the Augustan age more
      broadly. For instance, Feldherr 2010, 83, proposes that &#x201C;the kind of
      interpretative choices required of Ovid&#x2019;s audience really do imitate
      and reproduce the hermeneutic challenges that lay at the core of the
      political impact of the emperor&#x2019;s actual monuments.&#x201D; See also
      Galinsky 1996, 228-229, arguing that &#x201C;the <em>Metamorphoses</em> calls for
      the constant participation of the beholder. There is an authorial
      center as the poet is very much in evidence, ultimately tying
      together the heterogeneity and flux of the material: the parallel
      with Augustus&#x2019; similar role in the public realm is suggestive,&#x201D; as
      well as Wickkiser 1999, 122-123, where she claims that the
      <em>sphragis</em> in particular is &#x201C;a response to Augustus and the Augustan
      period&#x201D; because it employs an architectural metaphor to define
      itself. Although Wickkiser does look to the <em>Res Gestae</em> in her
      article on the end of the <em>Metamorphoses</em>, her focus is not on
      Augustus&#x2019; language, and she looks mostly to the physical buildings
      of his reign. There is no study I know of that examines how
      Augustus&#x2019; strategy at the end of the <em>Res Gestae</em> has a counterpart
      in the conclusion of Ovid&#x2019;s <em>Metamorphoses</em> despite the similarities
      that I will now point out below. <a href="#fnref:454" class="reversefootnote">&#x21A9;</a></p>

      not only the affection and responsibility a father feels towards his
      children, familiar to modern society, but also the obedience
      required by Roman law from children to their father, as enshrined in

            <p>Milnor 2005, 47-93, provides an excellent discussion of the way
      that Augustus&#x2019; complex of buildings on the Palatine, including his
      own house and adjacent temple of Apollo, helped to demonstrate
      visually as well as symbolically the redefinition of the boundaries
      between public and private space. In short, Milnor concludes that
      &#x201C;[t]he Palatine complex&#x2026;serve[d] to underscore certain concrete
      issues about the relationship between public and private space in
      the Augustan age, and also, in a symbolic sense, to address the
      question of what it means for a single individual to take to himself
      alone the power which used to belong to an entire community&#x201D; (50).
      Milnor cites as a crucial piece of evidence a passage from Cassius
      Dio that suggests how Augustus&#x2019; house was at once both private and
      public, open and closed. &#x201C;When Augustus had constructed his house,&#x201D;
      according to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-century CE historian, &#x201C;he donated it to the
      state, whether because of the contribution from the people to him,
      or since he was high priest, in order that he could live in places
      that were simultaneously private and public&#x201D; (&#x1F41; &#x3B4;&#x1F72; &#x391;&#x1F54;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x1F74;&#x3BD;

      &#x201C;decreed&#x201D; by the senate and the people of Rome. In other words,

      to note that &#x201C;Augustus as the representative of household virtue is
      still very much alive at the text&#x2019;s conclusion <em>even though Octavian
      the private citizen has long since perished</em>&#x201D; (my emphasis). In this
